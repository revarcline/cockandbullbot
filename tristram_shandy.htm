<p>
N<small>EVER</small> poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his
Dedication, than I have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of
the kingdom, and in a retir’d thatch’d house, where I live in a
constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other
evils of life, by mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man
smiles,——but much more so, when he laughs, it adds something to
this Fragment of Life.
</p>

<p>
I humbly beg, Sir, that you will honour this book, by taking it—(not
under your Protection,—it must protect itself, but)—into the
country with you; where, if I am ever told, it has made you smile; or can
conceive it has beguiled you of one moment’s pain—I shall think
myself as happy as a minister of state;——perhaps much happier than
any one (one only excepted) that I have read or heard of.

TRISTRAM SHANDY, Gent.
</h2>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp; &nbsp;I</small>
</h3>

<p>
I <small>WISH</small> either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as
they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about
when they begot me; had they duly consider’d how much depended upon what
they were then doing;—that not only the production of a rational Being
was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of
his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;—and, for
aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might
take their turn fromthe humours and dispositions which were then
uppermost;—Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and
proceeded accordingly,—I am verily persuaded I should have made a
quite different figure in the world, from that in which the reader is likely to
see me.—Believe me, good folks, this is not so inconsiderable a thing as
many of you may think it;—you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal
spirits, as how they are transfused from father to son, &amp;c.
&amp;c.—and a great deal to that purpose:—Well, you may take my
word, that nine parts in ten of a man’s sense or his nonsense, his
successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and
activity, and the different tracks and trains you put them into, so that when
they are once set a-going, whether right or wrong, ’tis not a half-penny
matter,—away they go cluttering like hey-go mad; and by treading the same
steps over and over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as
smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the Devil himself
sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.
</p>

<p><i>Pray my Dear</i>, quoth my mother, <i>have you not forgot to
wind up the clock?—Good G—!</i> cried my father, making
an exclamation, but taking care to moderate his voice at the same
time,——<i>Did ever woman, since the creation of the
world, interrupt a man with such a silly question?</i> Pray, what
was your father saying?————Nothing.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.
&nbsp;&nbsp;II</small>
</h3>

<p>———Then, positively, there is
nothing in the question that I can see, either good or
bad.——Then, let me tell you, Sir, it was a very
unseasonable question at least,—because it scattered and
dispersed the animal spirits, whose business it was to have
escorted and gone hand in hand with the <i>HOMUNCULUS</i>, and
conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.</p>

<p>The H<small>OMUNCULUS</small>, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in this age
of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice;—to the eye of
reason in scientific research, he stands confess’d—a
B<small>EING</small> guarded and circumscribed with
rights.——The minutest philosophers, who by the bye,
have the most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely
as their enquiries) shew us incontestably, that the
H<small>OMUNCULUS</small> is created by the same
hand,—engender’d in the same course of
nature,—endow’d with the same loco-motive powers and
faculties with us:—That he consists as we do, of skin, hair,
fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages, bones,
marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and
articulations;—is a Being of as much activity,—and in
all senses of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as
my Lord Chancellor of <i>England.</i>—He may be
benefitted,—he may be injured,—he may obtain redress;
in a word, he has all the claims and rights of humanity, which
<i>Tully, Puffendorf</i>, or the best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and
relation.</p>

<p>Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way
alone!—or that through terror of it, natural to so young a
traveller, my little Gentleman had got to his journey’s end
miserably spent;—his muscular strength and virility worn down
to a thread;—his own animal spirits ruffled beyond
description,—and that in this sad disorder’d state of
nerves, he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of
melancholy dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months
together.—I tremble to think what a foundation had been laid
for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of
the physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set
thoroughly to rights.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P. &nbsp; III</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>O</small> my uncle Mr. <i>Toby Shandy</i> do
I stand indebted for the preceding anecdote, to whom my father, who
was an excellent natural philosopher, and much given to
close reasoning upon the smallest matters, had oft, and heavily
complained of the injury; but once more particularly, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> well remember’d, upon his observing a most
unaccountable obliquity, (as he call’d it) in my manner of
setting up my top, and justifying the principles upon which I had
done it,—the old gentleman shook his head, and in a tone more
expressive by half of sorrow than reproach,—he said his heart
all along foreboded, and he saw it verified in this, and from a
thousand other observations he had made upon me, That I should
neither think nor act like any other man’s
child:—<i>But alas!</i> continued he, shaking his head a
second time, and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his
cheeks, <i>My Tristram’s misfortunes began nine months before
ever he came into the world.</i></p>

<p>—My mother, who was sitting by, look’d up, but she
knew no more than her backside what my father meant,—but my
uncle, Mr. <i>Toby Shandy</i>, who had been often informed of the affair,—understood
him very well.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IV</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>KNOW</small> there are readers in the
world, as well as many other good people in it, who are no readers
at all,—who find themselves ill at ease, unless they are let
into the whole secret from first to last, of every thing which
concerns you.</p>

<p>It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a
backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that I
have been so very particular already. As my life and opinions are
likely to make some noise in the world, and, if I conjecture right,
will take in all ranks, professions, and denominations of men
whatever,—be no less read than the <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i> itself—and in the end, prove the very thing
which <i>Montaigne</i> dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is,
a book for a parlour-window;—I find it necessary to consult
every one a little in his turn; and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little farther in the same way:
For which cause, right glad I am, that I have begun the history of
myself in the way I have done; and that I am able to go on, tracing
every thing in it, as <i>Horace</i> says, <i>ab Ovo.</i></p>

<p><i>Horace</i>, I know, does not recommend this fashion
altogether: But that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or
a tragedy;—(I forget which,) besides, if it was not so, I
should beg Mr. <i>Horace’s</i> pardon;—for in writing
what I have set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules,
nor to any man’s rules that ever lived.</p>

<p>To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these
things, I can give no better advice than that they skip over the
remaining part of this chapter; for I declare before-hand,
’tis wrote only for the curious and inquisitive.</p>

<p>——————Shut the
door.—————— I was begot in the
night betwixt the first <i>Sunday</i> and the first <i>Monday</i>
in the month of <i>March</i>, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and eighteen. I am positive I was.—But how I came to be so
very particular in my account of a thing which happened before I
was born, is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own
family, but now made publick for the better clearing up this
point.</p>

<p>My father, you must know, who was originally a <i>Turkey</i>
merchant, but had left off business for some years, in order to
retire to, and die upon, his paternal estate in the county of
——, was, I believe, one of the most regular men in
every thing he did, whether ’twas matter of business, or
matter of amusement, that ever lived. As a small specimen of this
extreme exactness of his, to which he was in truth a slave, he had
made it a rule for many years of his life,—on the first
<i>Sunday-night</i> of every month throughout the whole
year,—as certain as ever the <i>Sunday-night</i>
came,—to wind up a large house-clock, which we had standing
on the back-stairs head, with his own hands:—And being
somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I
have been speaking of,—he had likewise gradually
brought some other little family concernments to the same period,
in order, as he would often say to my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to get
them all out of the way at one time, and be no more plagued and
pestered with them the rest of the month.</p>

<p>It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great
measure, fell upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall
carry with me to my grave; namely, that from an unhappy association
of ideas, which have no connection in nature, it so fell out at
length, that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound
up,——but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably
popped into her head—<i>&amp; vice
versa:</i>——Which strange combination of ideas, the
sagacious <i>Locke</i>, who certainly understood the nature of
these things better than most men, affirms to have produced more
wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever.</p>

<p>But this by the bye.</p>

<p>Now it appears by a memorandum in my father’s pocket-book, which now lies upon
the table, “That on <i>Lady-day</i>, which was on the 25th of
the same month in which I date my geniture,——my father
set upon his journey to <i>London</i>, with my eldest brother
<i>Bobby</i>, to fix him at <i>Westminster</i> school;” and,
as it appears from the same authority, “That he did not get
down to his wife and family till the <i>second week</i> in
<i>May</i> following,”—it brings the thing almost to a
certainty. However, what follows in the beginning of the next
chapter, puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt.</p>

<p>———But pray, Sir, What was your father doing
all <i>December, January</i>, and
<i>February?</i>——Why, Madam,—he was all that
time afflicted with a Sciatica.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;V</small>
</h3>

<p>O<small>N</small> the fifth day of <i>November</i>,
1718, which to the æra fixed on, was as near nine kalendar
months as any husband could in reason have expected,—was I
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>, Gentleman, brought forth into this scurvy and disastrous world
of ours.—I wish I had been born in the Moon, or in any of the
planets, (except <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Saturn</i>, because I never
could bear cold weather) for it could not well have fared worse
with me in any of them (though I will not answer for <i>Venus</i>)
than it has in this vile, dirty planet of ours,—which,
o’ my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to be
made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest;——not
but the planet is well enough, provided a man could be born in it
to a great title or to a great estate; or could any how contrive to
be called up to public charges, and employments of dignity or
power;——but that is not my case;——and
therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has
gone in it;———for which cause I affirm it over
again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made;—for
I can truly say, that from the first hour I drew my breath in it,
to this, that I can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got
in scating against the wind in <i>Flanders;</i>—I have been the
continual sport of what the world calls Fortune; and though I will
not wrong her by saying, She has ever made me feel the weight of
any great or signal evil;——yet with all the good temper
in the world I affirm it of her, that in every stage of my life,
and at every turn and corner where she could get fairly at me, the
ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful
misadventures and cross accidents as ever small H<small>ERO</small>
sustained.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VI</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> the beginning of the last chapter,
I informed you exactly <i>when</i> I was born; but I did not inform
you <i>how. No</i>, that particular was reserved entirely for a
chapter by itself;—besides, Sir, as you and I are in a manner
perfect strangers to each other, it would not have been proper to
have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at
once.</p>

<p>—You must have a little patience. I have undertaken, you see, to write not only my life,
but my opinions also; hoping and expecting that your knowledge of
my character, and of what kind of a mortal I am, by the one, would
give you a better relish for the other: As you proceed farther with
me, the slight acquaintance, which is now beginning betwixt us,
will grow into familiarity; and that unless one of us is in fault,
will terminate in friendship.—<i>O diem
praeclarum!</i>—then nothing which has touched me will be
thought trifling in its nature, or tedious in its telling.
Therefore, my dear friend and companion, if you should think me
somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting out—bear
with me,—and let me go on, and tell my story my own
way:—Or, if I should seem now and then to trifle upon the
road,—or should sometimes put on a fool’s cap with a
bell to it, for a moment or two as we pass along,—don’t
fly off,—but rather courteously give me credit for a little
more wisdom than appears upon my outside;—and as we jog on, either laugh with me, or at me, or in short do
any thing,—only keep your temper.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> the same village where my father
and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a thin, upright, motherly, notable,
good old body of a midwife, who with the help of a little plain
good sense, and some years full employment in her business, in
which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts, and a
great deal to those of dame Nature,—had acquired, in her way,
no small degree of reputation in the world:—by which word
<i>world</i>, need I in this place inform your worship, that I
would be understood to mean no more of it, than a small circle
described upon the circle of the great world, of four
<i>English</i> miles diameter, or thereabouts, of which the cottage
where the good old woman lived is supposed to be the
centre?—She had been left it seems a widow in great distress,
with three or four small children, in her forty-seventh year; and as she was at that time a person of decent
carriage,—grave deportment,—a woman moreover of few
words and withal an object of compassion, whose distress, and
silence under it, called out the louder for a friendly lift: the
wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity; and having
often lamented an inconvenience to which her husband’s flock
had for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no such
thing as a midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the
case have been never so urgent, within less than six or seven long
miles riding; which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal
roads, the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was
almost equal to fourteen; and that in effect was sometimes next to
having no midwife at all; it came into her head, that it would be
doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish, as to the poor
creature herself, to get her a little instructed in some of the
plain principles of the business, in order to set her up in it. As
no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan
she had formed than herself, the gentlewoman very charitably
undertook it; and having great influence over the female part of
the parish, she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost
of her wishes. In truth, the parson join’d his interest with
his wife’s in the whole affair, and in order to do things as
they should be, and give the poor soul as good a title by law to
practise, as his wife had given by institution,—he cheerfully
paid the fees for the ordinary’s licence himself, amounting
in the whole, to the sum of eighteen shillings and four pence; so
that betwixt them both, the good woman was fully invested in the
real and corporal possession of her office, together with all its
<i>rights, members, and appurtenances whatsoever.</i></p>

<p>These last words, you must know, were not according to the old
form in which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran,
which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the
sisterhood. But it was according to a neat <i>Formula</i> of
<i>Didius</i> his own devising, who having a particular turn for
taking to pieces, and new framing over again all kind of
instruments in that way, not only hit upon this dainty amendment,
but coaxed many of the old licensed matrons in the neighbourhood,
to open their faculties afresh, in order to have this wham-wham of
his inserted.</p>

<p>I own I never could envy <i>Didius</i> in these kinds of fancies
of his:—But every man to his own taste.—Did not Dr.
<i>Kunastrokius</i>, that great man, at his leisure hours, take the
greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses tails, and plucking
the dead hairs out with his teeth, though he had tweezers always in
his pocket? Nay, if you come to that, Sir, have not the wisest of
men in all ages, not excepting <i>Solomon</i> himself,—have
they not had their
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSES</small>;—their running
horses,—their coins and their cockle-shells, their drums and
their trumpets, their fiddles, their pallets,—their maggots
and their butterflies?—and so long as a man rides his
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> peaceably and quietly
along the King’s highway, and neither compels you or me to
get up behind him,—pray, Sir, what have either you or I to do
with it?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VIII</small>
</h3>

<p>—<i>De gustibus non est
disputandum;</i>—that is, there is no disputing against
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSES</small>; and for my part, I
seldom do; nor could I with any sort of grace, had I been an enemy
to them at the bottom; for happening, at certain intervals and
changes of the moon, to be both fidler and painter, according as
the fly stings:—Be it known to you, that I keep a couple of
pads myself, upon which, in their turns, (nor do I care who knows
it) I frequently ride out and take the air;—though sometimes,
to my shame be it spoken, I take somewhat longer journies than what
a wise man would think altogether right.—But the truth
is,—I am not a wise man;—and besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world,
it is not much matter what I do: so I seldom fret or fume at all
about it: Nor does it much disturb my rest, when I see such great
Lords and tall Personages as hereafter follow;—such, for
instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P,
Q, and so on, all of a row, mounted upon their several
horses,—some with large stirrups, getting on in a more grave
and sober pace;——others on the contrary, tucked up to
their very chins, with whips across their mouths, scouring and
scampering it away like so many little party-coloured devils
astride a mortgage,—and as if some of them were resolved to
break their necks.——So much the better—say I to
myself;—for in case the worst should happen, the world will
make a shift to do excellently well without them; and for the
rest,——why——God speed
them——e’en let them ride on without opposition
from me; for were their lordships unhorsed this very
night—’tis ten to one but that many of them would
be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in
upon my rest.——But there is an instance, which I own
puts me off my guard, and that is, when I see one born for great
actions, and what is still more for his honour, whose nature ever
inclines him to good ones;—when I behold such a one, my Lord,
like yourself, whose principles and conduct are as generous and
noble as his blood, and whom, for that reason, a corrupt world
cannot spare one moment;—when I see such a one, my Lord,
mounted, though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my
love to my country has prescribed to him, and my zeal for his glory
wishes,—then, my Lord, I cease to be a philosopher, and in
the first transport of an honest impatience, I wish the
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>, with all his fraternity,
at the Devil.</p>

<p class="letter">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My Lord,<br>
I <small>MAINTAIN</small> this to be a dedication, notwithstanding
its singularity in the three great essentials of matter, form and
place: I beg, therefore, you will accept it as such, and that you
will permit me to lay it, with the most respectful humility, at
your Lordship’s feet—when you are upon
them,—which you can be when you please;—and that is, my
Lord, whenever there is occasion for it, and I will add, to the
best purposes too. I have the honour to be,
</p>

<p class="right">
<i>My Lord,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>I <small>SOLEMNLY</small> declare to all mankind,
that the above dedication was made for no one Prince, Prelate,
Pope, or Potentate,—Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, of this, or any other Realm in
Christendom;——nor has it yet been hawked about, or
offered publicly or privately, directly or indirectly, to any one
person or personage, great or small; but is honestly a true
Virgin-Dedication untried on, upon any soul living.</p>

<p>I labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any
offence or objection which might arise against it from the manner
in which I propose to make the most of it;—which is the
putting it up fairly to public sale; which I now do.</p>

<p>——Every author has a way of his own in bringing his
points to bear;—for my own part, as I hate chaffering and
higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry;—I resolved within
myself, from the very beginning, to deal squarely and openly with
your Great Folks in this affair, and try whether I should not come
off the better by it.</p>

<p>If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or
Baron, in these his Majesty’s dominions, who stands in need
of a tight, genteel dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by the bye,
unless it suits in some degree, I will not part with
it)——it is much at his service for fifty
guineas;——which I am positive is twenty guineas less
than it ought to be afforded for, by any man of genius.</p>

<p>My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a
gross piece of daubing, as some dedications are. The design, your
Lordship sees, is good,—the colouring transparent,—the
drawing not amiss;—or to speak more like a man of
science,—and measure my piece in the painter’s scale,
divided into 20,—I believe, my Lord, the outlines will turn
out as 12,—the composition as 9,—the colouring as
6,—the expression 13 and a half,—and the
design,—if I may be allowed, my Lord, to understand my own
<i>design</i>, and supposing absolute perfection in designing, to
be as 20,—I think it cannot well fall short of 19. Besides
all this,—there is keeping in it, and the dark strokes in the
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>, (which is a secondary
figure, and a kind of back-ground to the whole) give great force to the
principal lights in your own figure, and make it come off
wonderfully;—and besides, there is an air of originality in
the <i>tout ensemble.</i></p>

<p>Be pleased, my good Lord, to order the sum to be paid into the
hands of Mr. <i>Dodsley</i>, for the benefit of the author; and in
the next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged,
and your Lordship’s titles, distinctions, arms, and good
actions, be placed at the front of the preceding chapter: All
which, from the words, <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>, and
whatever else in this book relates to
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSES</small>, but no more, shall
stand dedicated to your Lordship.—The rest I dedicate to the
Moon, who, by the bye, of all the P<small>ATRONS</small> or
M<small>ATRONS</small> I can think of, has most power to set my
book a-going, and make the world run mad after it.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;X</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HATEVER</small> degree of small merit the
act of benignity in favour of the midwife might justly claim, or in
whom that claim truly rested,—at first sight seems not very
material to this history;——certain however it was, that
the gentlewoman, the parson’s wife, did run away at that time
with the whole of it: And yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking
but that the parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to
hit upon the design first,—yet, as he heartily concurred in
it the moment it was laid before him, and as heartily parted with
his money to carry it into execution, had a claim to some share of
it,—if not to a full half of whatever honour was due to
it.</p>

<p>The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter
otherwise.</p>

<p>Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a
probable guess at the grounds of this procedure.</p>

<p>Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of
the midwife’s licence, of which you have had so
circumstantial an account,—the parson we have to do with had
made himself a country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he
had committed against himself, his station, and his
office;—and that was in never appearing better, or otherwise
mounted, than upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value about
one pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten all description of
him, was full brother to <i>Rosinante</i>, as far as similitude
congenial could make him; for he answered his description to a
hair-breadth in every thing,—except that I do not remember
’tis any where said, that <i>Rosinante</i> was broken-winded;
and that, moreover, <i>Rosinante</i>, as is the happiness of most
<i>Spanish</i> horses, fat or lean,—was undoubtedly a horse
at all points.</p>

<p>I know very well that the H<small>ERO’S</small> horse was a horse of chaste deportment, which may
have given grounds for the contrary opinion: But it is as certain
at the same time that <i>Rosinante’</i>s continency (as may
be demonstrated from the adventure of the <i>Yanguesian</i>
carriers) proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but
from the temperance and orderly current of his blood.—And let
me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of very good chastity in
the world, in behalf of which you could not say more for your
life.</p>

<p>Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to
every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic
work,—I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don
<i>Quixote’</i>s horse;——in all other points, the
parson’s horse, I say, was just such another, for he was as
lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as H<small>UMILITY</small>
herself could have bestrided.</p>

<p>In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it
was greatly in the parson’s power to have helped the figure of this horse of his,—for he was master
of a very handsome demi-peaked saddle, quilted on the seat with
green plush, garnished with a double row of silver-headed studs,
and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing
altogether suitable, of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of
black lace, terminating in a deep, black, silk fringe,
<i>poudré d’or</i>,—all which he had purchased
in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed
bridle, ornamented at all points as it should be.——But
not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these up behind his
study door: and, in lieu of them, had seriously befitted him with
just such a bridle and such a saddle, as the figure and value of
such a steed might well and truly deserve.</p>

<p>In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring
visits to the gentry who lived around him,—you will easily
comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see
enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. To speak the truth, he
never could enter a village, but he caught the attention
of both old and young.——Labour stood still as he
pass’d——the bucket hung suspended in the middle
of the well,—the spinning-wheel forgot its
round,——even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves
stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was
not of the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to
make his observations,—to hear the groans of the
serious,—and the laughter of the light-hearted; all which he
bore with excellent tranquillity.—His character was,—he
loved a jest in his heart—and as he saw himself in the true
point of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry with others
for seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: So
that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money,
and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the
extravagance of his humour,—instead of giving the true
cause,—he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself;
and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones, being altogether
as spare a figure as his beast,—he would sometimes insist
upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider
deserved;—that they were, centaur-like,—both of a
piece. At other times, and in other moods, when his spirits were
above the temptation of false wit,—he would say, he found
himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great gravity,
would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without
a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and
that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to
keep himself in countenance, but in spirits.</p>

<p>At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite
reasons for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse,
preferably to one of mettle;—for on such a one he could sit
mechanically, and meditate as delightfully <i>de vanitate mundi et
fugâ fæculi</i>, as with the advantage of a
death’s-head before him;—that, in all other
exercitations, he could spend his time, as he rode slowly along,—to as
much account as in his study;—that he could draw up an
argument in his sermon,—or a hole in his breeches, as
steadily on the one as in the other;—that brisk trotting and
slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible
movements.—But that upon his steed—he could unite and
reconcile every thing,—he could compose his sermon—he
could compose his cough,——and, in case nature gave a
call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep.—In
short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but
the true cause,—and he with-held the true one, only out of a
nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</p>

<p>But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of
this gentleman’s life, and about the time when the superb
saddle and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or
vanity, or call it what you will,—to run into the opposite
extreme.—In the language of the county where he dwelt, he was said to
have loved a good horse, and generally had one of the best in the
whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling: and
as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the
village than seven miles, and in a vile country,—it so fell
out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together
without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not
an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more
distressful than the last;—as much as he loved his beast, he
had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally
this; that his horse was either clapp’d, or spavin’d,
or greaz’d;—or he was twitter-bon’d, or
broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him,
which would let him carry no flesh;—so that he had every nine
or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,—and a good horse to
purchase in his stead.</p>

<p>What the loss in such a balance might amount to, <i>communibus
annis</i>, I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick,
to determine;—but let it be what it would, the honest
gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length,
by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to
take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing the whole,
and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned
to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as
to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish:
Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped
away, he could do ten times as much good;—and what still
weighed more with him than all other considerations put together,
was this, that it confined all his charity into one particular
channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the least wanted, namely,
to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish;
reserving nothing for the impotent,—nothing for the
aged,—nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly
called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness and affliction dwelt together.</p>

<p>For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and
there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out
of it;—and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law
never more to lend his steed upon any application
whatever,—or else be content to ride the last poor devil,
such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to
the very end of the chapter.</p>

<p>As he dreaded his own constancy in the first—he very
chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he could very
well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,—yet, for
that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear
the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than
undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a panegyrick
upon himself.</p>

<p>I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments
of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the
honest refinements of the peerless knight of <i>La Mancha</i>,
whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would
actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the
greatest hero of antiquity.</p>

<p>
But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to shew the
temper of the world in the whole of this affair.—For you must know, that
so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit,—the devil
a soul could find it out,—I suppose his enemies would not, and that his
friends could not.——But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf
of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary’s licence to set her
up,—but the whole secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two
horses more than ever he had lost, with all the circumstances of their
destruction, were known and distinctly remembered.—The story ran like
wild-fire.—“The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just
seized him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if
it was so, ’twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he would pocket the
expence of the licence ten times told, the very first year:—So that every
body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.”
</p>

<p>What were his views in this, and in every other action of his
life,—or rather what were the opinions which floated in the
brains of other people concerning it, was a thought which too much
floated in his own, and too often broke in upon his rest, when he
should have been sound asleep.</p>

<p>About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be
made entirely easy upon that score,—it being just so long
since he left his parish,—and the whole world at the same
time behind him,—and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he
will have no cause to complain.</p>

<p>But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order
them as they will, they pass thro’ a certain medium, which so twists and refracts them from their true
directions——that, with all the titles to praise which a
rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are nevertheless
forced to live and die without it.</p>

<p>Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful
example.——But to know by what means this came to
pass,—and to make that knowledge of use to you, I insist upon
it that you read the two following chapters, which contain such a
sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along
with it.—When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way,
we will go on with the midwife.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XI</small>
</h3>

<p>Yorick was this parson’s name, and, what is
very remarkable in it, (as appears from a most ancient account of
the family, wrote upon strong vellum, and now in perfect
preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for near,—I
was within an ace of saying nine hundred
years;——but I would not shake my credit in telling an
improbable truth, however indisputable in itself,——and
therefore I shall content myself with only saying——It
had been exactly so spelt, without the least variation or
transposition of a single letter, for I do not know how long; which
is more than I would venture to say of one half of the best
surnames in the kingdom; which, in a course of years, have
generally undergone as many chops and changes as their
owners.—Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame of
the respective proprietors?—In honest truth, I think
sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the other, just as the
temptation has wrought. But a villainous affair it is, and will one
day so blend and confound us all together, that no one shall be
able to stand up and swear, “That his own great
grandfather was the man who did either this or that.”</p>

<p>This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent
care of the <i>Yorick’</i>s family, and their religious
preservation of these records I quote, which do farther inform us,
That the family was originally of <i>Danish</i> extraction, and had
been transplanted into England as early as in the reign of
<i>Horwendillus</i>, king of <i>Denmark</i>, in whose court, it
seems, an ancestor of this Mr. <i>Yorick</i>’s, and from whom
he was lineally descended, held a considerable post to the day of
his death. Of what nature this considerable post was, this record
saith not;—it only adds, That, for near two centuries, it had
been totally abolished, as altogether unnecessary, not only in that
court, but in every other court of the Christian world.</p>

<p>It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other
than that of the king’s chief Jester;—and that
<i>Hamlet</i>’s <i>Yorick</i>, in our <i>Shakespeare</i>,
many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated
facts, was certainly the very man.</p>

<p>I have not the time to look into <i>Saxo-Grammaticus</i>’s
<i>Danish</i> history, to know the certainty of this;—but if
you have leisure, and can easily get at the book, you may do
it full as well yourself.</p>

<p>I had just time, in my travels through <i>Denmark</i> with Mr.
<i>Noddy</i>’s eldest son, whom, in the year 1741, I
accompanied as governor, riding along with him at a prodigious rate
thro’ most parts of Europe, and of which original journey
performed by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in
the progress of this work. I had just time, I say, and that was
all, to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner
in that country;——namely, “That nature was
neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius
and capacity to its inhabitants;—but, like a discreet parent,
was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in
the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points,
pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with
few instances in that kingdom of refined parts; but a great
deal of good plain houshold understanding amongst all
ranks of people, of which every body has a share;” which is,
I think, very right.</p>

<p>With us, you see, the case is quite different:—we are all
ups and downs in this matter;—you are a great
genius;—or ’tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great
dunce and a blockhead;—not that there is a total want of
intermediate steps,—no,—we are not so irregular as that
comes to;—but the two extremes are more common, and in a
greater degree in this unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts
and dispositions of this kind, is most whimsical and capricious;
fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and
chattels than she.</p>

<p>This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to
<i>Yorick</i>’s extraction, who, by what I can remember of
him, and by all the accounts I could ever get of him, seemed not to
have had one single drop of <i>Danish</i> blood in his whole
crasis; in nine hundred years, it might possibly have all run out:——I will not
philosophize one moment with you about it; for happen how it would,
the fact was this:—That instead of that cold phlegm and exact
regularity of sense and humours, you would have looked for, in one
so extracted;—he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and
sublimated a composition,—as heteroclite a creature in all
his declensions;—with as much life and whim, and
<i>gaité de cœur</i> about him, as the kindliest
climate could have engendered and put together. With all this sail,
poor <i>Yorick</i> carried not one ounce of ballast; he was utterly
unpractised in the world; and at the age of twenty-six, knew just
about as well how to steer his course in it, as a romping,
unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon his first setting out,
the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul
ten times in a day of somebody’s tackling; and as the grave
and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,——you may
likewise imagine, ’twas with such he had generally the ill
luck to get the most entangled. For aught I know there might be
some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such
<i>Fracas:</i>——For, to speak the truth, <i>Yorick</i>
had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to
gravity;—not to gravity as such;—for where gravity was
wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for
days and weeks together;—but he was an enemy to the
affectation of it, and declared open war against it, only as it
appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it
fell in his way, however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it
much quarter.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, that
Gravity was an errant scoundrel, and he would add,—of the
most dangerous kind too,—because a sly one; and that he
verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out
of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by
pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper which
a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no danger,—but to itself:—whereas the very
essence of gravity was design, and consequently
deceit;—’twas a taught trick to gain credit of the
world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that,
with all its pretensions,—it was no better, but often worse,
than what a <i>French</i> wit had long ago defined
it,—<i>viz. A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the
defects of the mind;</i>—which definition of gravity,
<i>Yorick</i>, with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be
wrote in letters of gold.</p>

<p>But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in
the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every
other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress
restraint. <i>Yorick</i> had no impression but one, and that was
what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression
he would usually translate into plain <i>English</i> without any
periphrasis;—and too oft without much distinction of either
person, time, or place;—so that when mention was made of a
pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding——he never gave
himself a moment’s time to reflect who was the hero of the
piece,——what his station,——or how far he
had power to hurt him hereafter;—but if it was a dirty
action,—without more ado,—The man was a dirty
fellow,—and so on.—And as his comments had usually the
ill fate to be terminated either in a <i>bon mot</i>, or to be
enlivened throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it
gave wings to <i>Yorick</i>’s indiscretion. In a word,
tho’ he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom
shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much
ceremony;——he had but too many temptations in life, of
scattering his wit and his humour,—his gibes and his jests
about him.——They were not lost for want of
gathering.</p>

<p>What were the consequences, and what was <i>Yorick</i>’s

</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> <i>Mortgager</i> and
<i>Mortgagee</i> differ the one from the other, not more in length
of purse, than the <i>Jester</i> and <i>Jestee</i> do, in that of
memory. But in this the comparison between them runs, as the
scholiasts call it, upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one
or two legs more than some of the best of <i>Homer</i>’s can
pretend to;—namely, That the one raises a sum, and the other
a laugh at your expence, and thinks no more about it. Interest,
however, still runs on in both cases;—the periodical or
accidental payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the
affair alive; till, at length, in some evil hour, pop comes the
creditor upon each, and by demanding principal upon the spot,
together with full interest to the very day, makes them both feel
the full extent of their obligations.</p>

<p>As the reader (for I hate your <i>ifs</i>) has a thorough
knowledge of human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my
H<small>ERO</small> could not go on at this rate without some
slight experience of these incidental mementos. To speak the truth,
he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts
of this stamp, which, notwithstanding <i>Eugenius</i>’s
frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one
of them was contracted thro’ any malignancy;—but, on
the contrary, from an honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity of
humour, they would all of them be cross’d out in course.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius</i> would never admit this; and would often tell
him, that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and
he would often add, in an accent of sorrowful
apprehension,—to the uttermost mite. To which <i>Yorick</i>,
with his usual carelessness of heart, would as often answer with a
pshaw!—and if the subject was started in the
fields,—with a hop, skip, and a jump at the end of it; but if
close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where the culprit
was barricado’d in, with a table and a couple of
arm-chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a
tangent,—<i>Eugenius</i> would then go on with his lecture
upon discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat better
put together.</p>

<p>Trust me, dear <i>Yorick</i>, this unwary pleasantry of thine
will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties,
which no after-wit can extricate thee out of.——In these
sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person laughed at,
considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all the
rights of such a situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest
him in that light too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his
kindred and allies,——and musters up with them the many
recruits which will list under him from a sense of common
danger;—’tis no extravagant arithmetic to say, that for
every ten jokes,—thou hast got an hundred enemies; and till
thou hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears,
and art half stung to death by them, thou wilt never be
convinced it is so.</p>

<p>I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the
least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these
sallies—I believe and know them to be truly honest and
sportive:—But consider, my dear lad, that fools cannot
distinguish this,—and that knaves will not: and thou knowest
not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with
the other:——whenever they associate for mutual defence,
depend upon it, they will carry on the war in such a manner against
thee, my dear friend, as to make thee heartily sick of it, and of
thy life too.</p>

<p>
Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee, which
no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right.——The
fortunes of thy house shall totter,—thy character, which led the way to
them, shall bleed on every side of it,—thy faith questioned,—thy
works belied,—thy wit forgotten,—thy learning trampled on. To wind
up the last scene of thy tragedy, C<small>RUELTY</small> and
C<small>OWARDICE</small>, twin ruffians, hired and set on by
M<small>ALICE</small> in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities
and mistakes:——The best of us, my dear lad, lie open
there,——and trust me,——trust me, <i>Yorick, when to
gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved upon, that an innocent and an
helpless creature shall be sacrificed, ’tis an easy matter to pick up
sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed, to make a fire to offer it
up with.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Yorick</i> scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his
destiny read over to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye,
and a promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the
time to come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.—But, alas,
too late!—a grand confederacy with ***** and ***** at the
head of it, was formed before the first prediction of it.—The
whole plan of the attack, just as <i>Eugenius</i> had foreboded,
was put in execution all at once,—with so little mercy on the side of the allies,—and so little
suspicion in <i>Yorick</i>, of what was carrying on against
him,—that when he thought, good easy man! full surely
preferment was o’ripening,—they had smote his root, and
then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.</p>

<p><i>Yorick</i>, however, fought it out with all imaginable
gallantry for some time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out
at length by the calamities of the war,—but more so, by the
ungenerous manner in which it was carried on,—he threw down
the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the
last, he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought, quite
broken-hearted.</p>

<p>What inclined <i>Eugenius</i> to the same opinion was as
follows:</p>

<p>
A few hours before <i>Yorick</i> breathed his last, <i>Eugenius</i> stept in
with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him. Upon his
drawing <i>Yorick</i>’s curtain, and asking how he felt himself,
<i>Yorick</i> looking up in his face took hold of his hand,—and after
thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said,
if it was their fate to meet hereafter,—he would thank him again and
again,—he told him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the
slip for ever.—I hope not, answered <i>Eugenius</i>, with tears trickling
down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke.—I hope
not, <i>Yorick</i>, said he.——<i>Yorick</i> replied, with a look
up, and a gentle squeeze of <i>Eugenius</i>’s hand, and that was
all,—but it cut <i>Eugenius</i> to his heart.—Come,—come,
<i>Yorick</i>, quoth <i>Eugenius</i>, wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man
within him,—my dear lad, be comforted,—let not all thy spirits and
fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants
them;——who knows what resources are in store, and what the power of
God may yet do for thee!——<i>Yorick</i> laid his hand upon his
heart, and gently shook his head;—For my part, continued <i>Eugenius</i>,
crying bitterly as he uttered the words,—I declare I know not,
<i>Yorick</i>, how to part with thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added
<i>Eugenius</i>, chearing up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee
to make a bishop, and that I may live to see it.—I beseech thee,
<i>Eugenius</i>, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, taking off his night-cap as well as he
could with his left hand,—his right being still grasped close in that of
<i>Eugenius</i>,—I beseech thee to take a view of my head.—I see
nothing that ails it, replied <i>Eugenius.</i> Then, alas! my friend, said
<i>Yorick</i>, let me tell you, that ’tis so bruised and mis-shapened
with the blows which ***** and *****, and some others have so unhandsomely
given me in the dark, that I might say with <i>Sancho Pança</i>, that should I
recover, and “Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as
thick as hail, not one of them would fit
it.”——<i>Yorick</i>’s last breath was hanging upon his
trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this:——yet still it
was uttered with something of a <i>Cervantick</i> tone;——and as he
spoke it, <i>Eugenius</i> could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up
for a moment in his eyes;——faint picture of those flashes of his
spirit, which (as <i>Shakespeare</i> said of his ancestor) were wont to set the
table in a roar!
</p>

<p><i>Eugenius</i> was convinced from this, that the heart of his
friend was broke: he squeezed his hand,——and then
walked softly out of the room, weeping as he walked. <i>Yorick</i>
followed <i>Eugenius</i> with his eyes to the door,—he then
closed them, and never opened them more.</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</div>

<p>
He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of
———, under a plain marble slab, which his friend
<i>Eugenius</i>, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more
than these three words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and
elegy.<br><br>

</tbody></table>

<p class="p2">
Ten times a day has <i>Yorick</i>’s ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as
denote a general pity and esteem for him;——a foot-way crossing the
church-yard close by the side of his grave,—not a passenger goes by
without stopping to cast a look upon it,—and sighing as he walks on,
</p>

<p class="center">Alas, poor YORICK!</p>

<p>I<small>T</small> is so long since the reader of
this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife, that it is
high time to mention her again to him, merely to put him in mind
that there is such a body still in the world, and whom, upon the
best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present, I am going to
introduce to him for good and all: But as fresh matter may be
started, and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader
and myself, which may require immediate
dispatch;——’twas right to take care that the poor
woman should not be lost in the mean time;—because when she
is wanted, we can no way do without her.</p>

<p>I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small
note and consequence throughout our whole village and
township;—that her fame had spread itself to the very
out-edge and circumference of that circle of importance, of which
kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his back or no,——has
one surrounding him;—which said circle, by the way, whenever
’tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance
in the <i>world</i>,——I desire may be enlarged or
contracted in your worship’s fancy, in a compound ratio of
the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height and depth
(measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.</p>

<p>In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or
five miles, which not only comprehended the whole parish, but
extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the
skirts of the next parish; which made a considerable thing of it. I
must add, That she was, moreover, very well looked on at one large
grange-house, and some other odd houses and farms within two or
three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own
chimney:——But I must here, once for all, inform you,
that all this will be more exactly delineated and explain’d
in a map, now in the hands of the engraver, which, with many other
pieces and developements of this work, will be added to the end of
the twentieth volume,—not to swell the work,—I detest
the thought of such a thing;—but by way of commentary,
scholium, illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or
inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private
interpretation, or of dark or doubtful meaning, after my life and
my opinions shall have been read over (now don’t forget the
meaning of the word) by all the <i>world</i>;——which,
betwixt you and me, and in spite of all the gentlemen-reviewers in
<i>Great Britain</i>, and of all that their worships shall
undertake to write or say to the contrary,—I am determined
shall be the case.—I need not tell your worship, that all
this is spoke in confidence.</p>

<p>U<small>PON</small> looking into my mother’s
marriage settlement, in order to satisfy myself and reader in a
point necessary to be cleared up, before we could proceed any farther in this history;—I had the
good fortune to pop upon the very thing I wanted before I had read
a day and a half straight forwards,—it might have taken me up
a month;—which shews plainly, that when a man sits down to
write a history,—tho’ it be but the history of <i>Jack
Hickathrift</i> or <i>Tom Thumb</i>, he knows no more than his
heels what lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his
way,—or what a dance he may be led, by one excursion or
another, before all is over. Could a historiographer drive on his
history, as a muleteer drives on his mule,—straight
forward;——for instance, from <i>Rome</i> all the way to
<i>Loretto</i>, without ever once turning his head aside, either to
the right hand or to the left,——he might venture to
foretell you to an hour when he should get to his journey’s
end;——but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible:
For, if he is a man of the least spirit, he will have fifty
deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as
he goes along, which he can no ways avoid. He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually
soliciting his eye, which he can no more help standing still to
look at than he can fly; he will moreover have various<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts to reconcile:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotes to pick up:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inscriptions to make out:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stories to weave in:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditions to sift:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personages to call upon:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panegyricks to paste up at this door;</p>

<p>Pasquinades at that:——All which both the man and his
mule are quite exempt from. To sum up all; there are archives at
every stage to be look’d into, and rolls, records, documents,
and endless genealogies, which justice ever and anon calls him back
to stay the reading of:——In short there is no end of
it;——for my own part, I declare I have been at it these
six weeks, making all the speed I possibly could,—and am not
yet born:—I have just been able, and that’s all, to
tell you <i>when</i> it happen’d, but not <i>how</i>;—so that you see the thing is yet
far from being accomplished.</p>

<p>These unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of
when I first set out;—but which, I am convinced now, will
rather increase than diminish as I advance,—have struck out a
hint which I am resolved to follow;——and that
is,—not to be in a hurry;—but to go on leisurely,
writing and publishing two volumes of my life every
year;——which, if I am suffered to go on quietly, and
can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall continue
to do as long as I live.</p>

<p>
T<small>HE</small> article in my mother’s marriage-settlement, which I
told the reader I was at the pains to search for, and which, now that I have
found it, I think proper to lay before him,—is so much more fully
express’d in the deed itself, than ever I can pretend to do it, that it
would be barbarity to take it out of the lawyer’s hand:—It is as
follows.
</p>

<p>
“And this Indenture further witnesseth, That the said <i>Walter
Shandy</i>, merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had,
and, by God’s blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and consummated
between the said <i>Walter Shandy</i> and <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i> aforesaid,
and divers other good and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto
specially moving,—doth grant, covenant, condescend, consent, conclude,
bargain, and fully agree to and with <i>John Dixon</i>, and <i>James
Turner</i>, Esqrs. the above-named Trustees, &amp;c. &amp;c.—to
wit,—That in case it should hereafter so fall out, chance, happen, or
otherwise come to pass,—That the said <i>Walter Shandy</i>, merchant,
shall have left off business before the time or times, that the said
<i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i> shall, according to the course of nature, or
otherwise, have left off bearing and bringing forth children;—and that,
in consequence of the said <i>Walter Shandy</i> having so left off business, he
shall in despight, and against the free-will, consent, and good-liking of the
said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i>,—make a departure from the city of
<i>London</i>, in order to retire to, and dwell upon, his estate at <i>Shandy
Hall</i>, in the county of ——, or at any other country-seat,
castle, hall, mansion-house, messuage or grainge-house, now purchased, or
hereafter to be purchased, or upon any part or parcel thereof:—That then,
and as often as the said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i> shall happen to be enceint
with child or children severally and lawfully begot, or to be begotten, upon
the body of the said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i>, during her said
coverture,—he the said <i>Walter Shandy</i> shall, at his own proper cost
and charges, and out of his own proper monies, upon good and reasonable notice,
which is hereby agreed to be within six weeks of her the said <i>Elizabeth
Mollineux</i>’s full reckoning, or time of supposed and computed
delivery,—pay, or cause to be paid, the sum of one hundred and twenty
pounds of good and lawful money, to <i>John Dixon</i>, and <i>James Turner</i>,
Esqrs. or assigns,—upon <small>TRUST</small> and confidence, and for and
unto the use and uses, intent, end, and purpose following:—That is to
say,—That the said sum of one hundred and twenty pounds shall be paid
into the hands of the said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i>, or to be otherwise
applied by them the said Trustees, for the well and truly hiring of one coach,
with able and sufficient horses, to carry and convey the body of the said
<i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i>, and the child or children which she shall be then
and there enceint and pregnant with,—unto the city of <i>London</i>; and
for the further paying and defraying of all other incidental costs, charges,
and expences whatsoever,—in and about, and for, and relating to, her said
intended delivery and lying-in, in the said city or suburbs thereof. And that
the said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i> shall and may, from time to time, and at
all such time and times as are here covenanted and agreed upon,—peaceably
and quietly hire the said coach and horses, and have free ingress, egress, and
regress throughout her journey, in and from the said coach, according to the
tenor, true intent, and meaning of these presents, without any let, suit,
trouble, disturbance, molestation, discharge, hinderance, forfeiture, eviction,
vexation, interruption, or incumbrance whatsoever.—And that it shall
moreover be lawful to and for the said <i>Elizabeth Mollineux</i>, from time to
time, and as oft or often as she shall well and truly be advanced in her said
pregnancy, to the time heretofore stipulated and agreed upon,—to live and
reside in such place or places, and in such family or families, and with such
relations, friends, and other persons within the said city of <i>London</i>, as
she at her own will and pleasure, notwithstanding her present coverture, and as
if she was a <i>femme sole</i> and unmarried,—shall think fit.—And
this Indenture further witnesseth, That for the more effectually carrying of
the said covenant into execution, the said <i>Walter Shandy</i>, merchant, doth
hereby grant, bargain, sell, release, and confirm unto the said <i>John
Dixon</i>, and <i>James Turner</i>, Esqrs. their heirs, executors, and assigns,
in their actual possession now being, by virtue of an indenture of bargain and
sale for a year to them the said <i>John Dixon</i>, and <i>James Turner</i>,
Esqrs. by him the said <i>Walter Shandy</i>, merchant, thereof made; which said
bargain and sale for a year, bears date the day next before the date of these
presents, and by force and virtue of the statute for transferring of uses into
possession,—All that the manor and lordship of <i>Shandy</i>, in the
county of ——, with all the rights, members, and appurtenances
thereof; and all and every the messuages, houses, buildings, barns, stables,
orchards, gardens, backsides, tofts, crofts, garths, cottages, lands, meadows,
feedings, pastures, marshes, commons, woods, underwoods, drains, fisheries,
waters, and water-courses;—together with all rents, reversions, services,
annuities, fee-farms, knights fees, views of frankpledge, escheats, reliefs,
mines, quarries, goods and chattels of felons and fugitives, felons of
themselves, and put in exigent, deodands, free warrens, and all other royalties
and seigniories, rights and jurisdictions, privileges and hereditaments
whatsoever.—And also the advowson, donation, presentation, and free
disposition of the rectory or parsonage of <i>Shandy</i> aforesaid, and all and
every the tenths, tythes, glebe-lands.”——In three
words,——“My mother was to lay in, (if she chose it) in
<i>London.</i>”
</p>

<p>But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to, and which indeed had never been
thought of at all, but for my uncle <i>Toby Shandy</i>;—a
clause was added in security of my father which was this:—“That in
case my mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father to the
trouble and expence of a <i>London</i> journey, upon false cries
and tokens;——that for every such instance, she should
forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the
next turn;——but to no more,—and so on, <i>toties
quoties</i>, in as effectual a manner, as if such a covenant
betwixt them had not been made.”—This, by the way, was
no more than what was reasonable;—and yet, as reasonable as
it was, I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the
article should have fallen entirely, as it did, upon myself.</p>

<p>But I was begot and born to misfortunes;—for my poor
mother, whether it was wind or water—or a compound of
both,—or neither;—or whether it was simply the mere
swell of imagination and fancy in her;—or how far a strong
wish and desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment;—in
short, whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no way becomes me to decide. The
fact was this, That in the latter end of September 1717, which was
the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up
to town much against the grain,—he peremptorily insisted upon
the clause;—so that I was doom’d, by marriage-articles,
to have my nose squeez’d as flat to my face, as if the
destinies had actually spun me without one.</p>

<p>How this event came about,—and what a train of vexatious
disappointments, in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me
from the mere loss, or rather compression, of this one single
member,—shall be laid before the reader all in due time.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVI</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father, as any body may naturally
imagine, came down with my mother into the country, in but a
pettish kind of a humour. The first twenty or five-and-twenty miles
he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself, and
indeed my mother too, about the cursed expence, which he said might
every shilling of it have been saved;—then what vexed him
more than every thing else was, the provoking time of the
year,—which, as I told you, was towards the end of
<i>September</i>, when his wall-fruit and green gages especially,
in which he was very curious, were just ready for
pulling:——“Had he been whistled up to
<i>London</i>, upon a <i>Tom Fool</i>’s errand, in any other
month of the whole year, he should not have said three words about
it.”</p>

<p>For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the
heavy blow he had sustain’d from the loss of a son, whom it
seems he had fully reckon’d upon in his mind, and
register’d down in his pocket-book, as a second staff for his
old age, in case <i>Bobby</i> should fail him. “The
disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man,
than all the money which the journey, &amp;c. had cost him, put
together,—rot the “hundred and twenty
pounds,——he did not mind it a rush.”</p>

<p>From <i>Stilton</i>, all the way to <i>Grantham</i>, nothing in
the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his
friends, and the foolish figure they should both make at church,
the first <i>Sunday</i>;——of which, in the satirical
vehemence of his wit, now sharpen’d a little by vexation, he
would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,—and
place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes
in the face of the whole congregation;—that my mother
declared, these two stages were so truly tragi-comical, that she
did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one end to the
other of them all the way.</p>

<p>From <i>Grantham</i>, till they had cross’d the
<i>Trent</i>, my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile
trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in
this affair—“Certainly,” he would say to
himself, over and over again, “the woman could not be
deceived herself——if she could,——“what
weakness!”—tormenting word!—which led his
imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play’d
the duce and all with him;——for sure as ever the word
<i>weakness</i> was uttered, and struck full upon his
brain—so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many
kinds of weaknesses there were;——that there was such a
thing as weakness of the body,——as well as weakness of
the mind,—and then he would do nothing but syllogize within
himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of all these
vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.</p>

<p>In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude
springing out of this one affair, all fretting successively in his
mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her
journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.——In a
word, as she complained to my uncle <i>Toby</i>, he would have
tired out the patience of any flesh alive.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> my father travelled homewards,
as I told you, in none of the best of moods,—pshawing and
pishing all the way down,—yet he had the complaisance to keep
the worst part of the story still to himself;—which was the
resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s clause in the marriage-settlement
empowered him; nor was it till the very night in which I was begot,
which was thirteen months after, that she had the least intimation
of his design: when my father, happening, as you remember, to be a
little chagrin’d and out of temper,——took
occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking
over what was to come,——to let her know that she must
accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made
between them in their marriage-deeds; which was to lye-in of her
next child in the country, to balance the last year’s
journey.</p>

<p>My father was a gentleman of many virtues,—but he had a
strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add
to the number.—’Tis known by the name of perseverance
in a good cause,—and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my
mother had so much knowledge, that she knew ’twas to no
purpose to make any remonstrance,—so she e’en resolved
to sit down quietly, and make the most of it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> the point was that night agreed, or rather
determined, that my mother should lye-in of me in the country, she
took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was
three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her
eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and
before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.
<i>Manningham</i> was not to be had, she had come to a final
determination in her mind,——notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within
so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had
expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of
midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the
sisterhood itself,——but had likewise super-added many
curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the fœtus
in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in
getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say,
was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into
no soul’s hand but this old woman’s only.—Now
this I like;——when we cannot get at the very thing we
wish——never to take up with the next best in degree to
it:—no; that’s pitiful beyond description;—it is
no more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing
this book for the edification of the world;—which is
<i>March</i> 9, 1759,——that my dear, dear <i>Jenny</i>,
observing I looked a little grave, as she stood cheapening a silk
of five-and-twenty shillings a yard,—told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so
much trouble;—and immediately went and bought herself a
yard-wide stuff of ten-pence a yard.—’Tis the
duplication of one and the same greatness of soul; only what
lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother’s case,
was, that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an
extreme, as one in her situation might have wished, because the old
midwife had really some little claim to be depended upon,—as
much, at least, as success could give her; having, in the course of
her practice of near twenty years in the parish, brought every
mother’s son of them into the world without any one slip or
accident which could fairly be laid to her account.</p>

<p>These facts, tho’ they had their weight, yet did not
altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung
upon my father’s spirits in relation to this choice.—To
say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and
justice—or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love,
all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this
kind;——he felt himself concerned in a particular
manner, that all should go right in the present case;—from
the accumulated sorrow he lay open to, should any evil betide his
wife and child in lying-in at <i>Shandy-Hall</i>.——He
knew the world judged by events, and would add to his afflictions
in such a misfortune, by loading him with the whole blame of
it.——“Alas o’day;—had Mrs.
<i>Shandy</i>, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to
town just to lye-in and come down again;—which they say, she
begged and prayed for upon her bare knees,——and which,
in my opinion, considering the fortune which Mr. <i>Shandy</i> got
with her,—was no such mighty matter to have complied with,
the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at this
hour.”</p>

<p>This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;—and
yet, it was not merely to shelter himself,—nor was it
altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so
extremely anxious about this point;—my father had extensive
views of things,——and stood moreover, as he thought,
deeply concerned in it for the publick good, from the dread he
entertained of the bad uses an ill-fated instance might be put
to.</p>

<p>He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject
had unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>’s reign down to his own time, that the
current of men and money towards the metropolis, upon one frivolous
errand or another,—set in so strong,—as to become
dangerous to our civil rights,—though, by the
bye,——a <i>current</i> was not the image he took most
delight in,—a <i>distemper</i> was here his favourite
metaphor, and he would run it down into a perfect allegory, by
maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in
the body natural, where the blood and spirits were driven up into
the head faster than they could find their ways
down;——a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which was
death in both cases.</p>

<p>There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties
by <i>French</i> politicks or <i>French</i>
invasions;——nor was he so much in pain of a consumption
from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our
constitution, which he hoped was not so bad as it was
imagined;—but he verily feared, that in some violent push, we
should go off, all at once, in a state-apoplexy;—and then he
would say, <i>The Lord have mercy upon us all.</i></p>

<p>My father was never able to give the history of this
distemper,—without the remedy along with it.</p>

<p>“Was I an absolute prince,” he would say,
pulling up his breeches with both his hands, as he rose from his
arm-chair, “I would appoint able judges, at every
avenue of my metropolis, who should take cognizance of every
fool’s business who came there;—and if, upon a fair and
candid hearing, it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his
own home, and come up, bag and baggage, with his wife and children,
farmer’s sons, &amp;c. &amp;c. at his backside, “they should be all sent back, from
constable to constable, like vagrants as they were, to the place of
their legal settlements. By this means I shall take care, that my
metropolis totter’d not thro’ its own
weight;—that the head be no longer too big for the
body;—that the extremes, now wasted and pinn’d in, be
restored to their due share of nourishment, and regain with it
their natural strength and beauty:—I would effectually
provide, That the meadows and corn fields of my dominions, should
laugh and sing;—that good chear and hospitality flourish once
more;—and that such weight and influence be put thereby into
the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise
what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them.”</p>

<p>
“Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen’s seats,” he
would ask, with some emotion, as he walked across the room, “throughout
so many delicious provinces in <i>France</i>? Whence is it that the few
remaining <i>Chateaus</i> amongst them are so dismantled,—so unfurnished,
and in so ruinous and desolate a condition?——Because, Sir”
(he would say) “in that kingdom no man has any country-interest to
support;—the little interest of any kind which any man has any where in
it, is concentrated in the court, and the looks of the Grand Monarch: by the
sunshine of whose countenance, or the clouds which pass across it, every
<i>French</i> man lives or dies.”
</p>

<p>Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to
guard against the least evil accident in my mother’s lying-in
in the country,——was, That any such instance would
infallibly throw a balance of power, too great already, into the
weaker vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher
stations;——which, with the many other usurped rights
which that part of the constitution was hourly
establishing,—would, in the end, prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick
government established in the first creation of things by God.</p>

<p>In this point he was entirely of Sir <i>Robert
Filmer</i>’s opinion, That the plans and institutions of the
greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of the world, were,
originally, all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of
this houshold and paternal power;—which, for a century, he
said, and more, had gradually been degenerating away into a
mix’d government;——the form of which, however
desirable in great combinations of the species,——was
very troublesome in small ones,—and seldom produced any
thing, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, private and publick, put
together,—my father was for having the man-midwife by all
means,—my mother, by no means. My father begg’d and
intreated, she would for once recede from her prerogative in this
matter, and suffer him to choose for her;—my mother, on the
contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter, to choose for
herself,—and have no mortal’s help but the old
woman’s.—What could my father do? He was almost at his
wit’s end;——talked it over with her in all
moods;—placed his arguments in all lights;—argued the
matter with her like a christian,—like a heathen,—like
a husband,—like a father,—like a patriot,—like a
man:—My mother answered every thing only like a woman; which
was a little hard upon her;—for as she could not assume and
fight it out behind such a variety of characters,—’twas
no fair match:—’twas seven to one.—What could my
mother do?—She had the advantage (otherwise she had been
certainly overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal
at the bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the
affair with my father with so equal an advantage,——that
both sides sung <i>Te Deum.</i> In a word, my mother was to have
the old woman,—and the operator was to have licence to drink
a bottle of wine with my father and my uncle <i>Toby Shandy</i> in the back
parlour,—for which he was to be paid five guineas.</p>

<p>I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a
caveat in the breast of my fair reader;—and it is
this,——Not to take it absolutely for granted, from an
unguarded word or two which I have dropp’d in
it,——“That I am a married
man.”—I own, the tender appellation of my dear, dear
<i>Jenny</i>,—with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge,
interspersed here and there, might, naturally enough, have misled
the most candid judge in the world into such a determination
against me.—All I plead for, in this case, Madam, is strict
justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as well as to
yourself,—as not to prejudge, or receive such an impression
of me, till you have better evidence, than, I am positive, at
present can be produced against me.—Not that I can be so vain
or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire you should therefore think,
that my dear, dear <i>Jenny</i> is my kept
mistress;—no,—that would be flattering my character in the other
extreme, and giving it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no
kind of right to. All I contend for, is the utter impossibility,
for some volumes, that you, or the most penetrating spirit upon
earth, should know how this matter really stands.—It is not
impossible, but that my dear, dear <i>Jenny!</i> tender as the
appellation is, may be my child.—Consider,—I was born
in the year eighteen.—Nor is there any thing unnatural or
extravagant in the supposition, that my dear <i>Jenny</i> may be my
friend.—Friend!—My friend.—Surely, Madam, a
friendship between the two sexes may subsist, and be supported
without———Fy! Mr. <i>Shandy:</i>—Without
any thing, Madam, but that tender and delicious sentiment which
ever mixes in friendship, where there is a difference of sex. Let
me intreat you to study the pure and sentimental parts of the best
<i>French</i> Romances;—it will really, Madam, astonish you
to see with what a variety of chaste expressions this delicious
sentiment, which I have the honour to speak of, is dress’d
out.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIX</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>WOULD</small> sooner undertake to explain
the hardest problem in geometry, than pretend to account for it,
that a gentleman of my father’s great good
sense,——knowing, as the reader must have observed him,
and curious too in philosophy,—wise also in political
reasoning,—and in polemical (as he will find) no way
ignorant,—could be capable of entertaining a notion in his
head, so out of the common track,—that I fear the reader,
when I come to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick
temper, will immediatly throw the book by; if mercurial, he will
laugh most heartily at it;—and if he is of a grave and
saturnine cast, he will, at first sight, absolutely condemn as
fanciful and extravagant; and that was in respect to the choice and
imposition of christian names, on which he thought a great deal
more depended than what superficial minds were capable of
conceiving.</p>

<p>His opinion, in this matter, was, That there was a strange kind
of magick bias, which good or bad names, as he called them,
irresistibly impressed upon our characters and conduct.</p>

<p>The hero of <i>Cervantes</i> argued not the point with more
seriousness,——nor had he more faith,——or
more to say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring his
deeds,—or on D<small>ULCINEA</small>’s name, in
shedding lustre upon them, than my father had on those of
T<small>RISMEGISTUS</small> or A<small>RCHIMEDES</small>, on the
one hand—or of N<small>YKY</small> and S<small>IMKIN</small>
on the other. How many C<small>ÆSARS</small> and
P<small>OMPEYS</small>, he would say, by mere inspiration of the
names, have been rendered worthy of them? And how many, he would
add, are there, who might have done exceeding well in the world,
had not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and
N<small>ICODEMUS’D</small> into nothing?</p>

<p>I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happened) my
father would say—that you do not heartily subscribe to this
opinion of mine,—which, to those, he would add, who have not
carefully sifted it to the bottom,—I own has an air more of
fancy than of solid reasoning in it;——and yet, my dear
Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am morally assured,
I should hazard little in stating a case to you, not as a party in
the dispute,—but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it
to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this
matter;——you are a person free from as many narrow
prejudices of education as most men;—and, if I may presume to
penetrate farther into you,—of a liberality of genius above
bearing down an opinion, merely because it wants friends. Your
son,—your dear son,—from whose sweet and open temper
you have so much to expect.—Your B<small>ILLY</small>,
Sir!—would you, for the world, have called him
J<small>UDAS</small>?—Would you, my dear Sir, he would say,
laying his hand upon your breast, with the genteelest
address,—and in that soft and irresistible <i>piano</i> of
voice, which the nature of the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>
absolutely requires,—Would you, Sir, if a <i>Jew</i> of a
godfather had proposed the name for your child, and offered you his
purse along with it, would you have consented to such a desecration
of him?——O my God! he would say, looking up, if I know
your temper right, Sir,—you are incapable of
it;——you would have trampled upon the offer;—you
would have thrown the temptation at the tempter’s head with
abhorrence.</p>

<p>Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that
generous contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole
transaction, is really noble;—and what renders it more so, is
the principle of it;—the workings of a parent’s love
upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis, namely, That
was your son called J<small>UDAS</small>,—the forbid and
treacherous idea, so inseparable from the name, would have
accompanied him through life like his shadow, and, in the end, made
a miser and a rascal of him, in spite, Sir, of your example.</p>

<p>
I never knew a man able to answer this argument.—But, indeed, to speak of
my father as he was;—he was certainly irresistible;—both in his
orations and disputations;—he was born an
orator;—Θεοδίδακτος.—Persuasion hung upon his lips, and the
elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in him,—and, withal,
he had so shrewd a guess at the weaknesses and passions of his
respondent,——that N<small>ATURE</small> might have stood up and
said,—“This man is eloquent.”—In short, whether he was
on the weak or the strong side of the question, ’twas hazardous in either
case to attack him.—And yet, ’tis strange, he had never read
<i>Cicero</i>, nor <i>Quintilian de Oratore</i>, nor <i>Isocrates</i>, nor
<i>Aristotle</i>, nor <i>Longinus</i>, amongst the antients;—nor
<i>Vossius</i>, nor <i>Skioppius</i>, nor <i>Ramus</i>, nor <i>Farnaby</i>,
amongst the moderns;—and what is more astonishing, he had never in his
whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck into his mind, by one
single lecture upon <i>Crackenthorp</i> or <i>Burgersdicius</i> or any
<i>Dutch</i> logician or commentator;—he knew not so much as in what the
difference of an argument <i>ad ignorantiam</i>, and an argument <i>ad
hominem</i> consisted; so that I well remember, when he went up along with me
to enter my name at <i>Jesus College</i> in ****,—it was a matter of just
wonder with my worthy tutor, and two or three fellows of that learned
society,—that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools,
should be able to work after that fashion with them.
</p>

<p>To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my
father was, however, perpetually forced upon;——for he
had a thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to
defend——most of which notions, I verily believe, at
first entered upon the footing of mere whims, and of a <i>vive la
Bagatelle</i>; and as such he would make merry with them for half
an hour or so, and having sharpened his wit upon them, dismiss them
till another day.</p>

<p>I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture
upon the progress and establishment of my father’s many
odd opinions,—but as a warning to the learned reader against
the indiscreet reception of such guests, who, after a free and
undisturbed entrance, for some years, into our brains,—at
length claim a kind of settlement there,——working
sometimes like yeast;—but more generally after the manner of
the gentle passion, beginning in jest,—but ending in
downright earnest.</p>

<p>Whether this was the case of the singularity of my
father’s notions—or that his judgment, at length,
became the dupe of his wit;—or how far, in many of his
notions, he might, though odd, be absolutely right;—the
reader, as he comes at them, shall decide. All that I maintain
here, is, that in this one, of the influence of christian names,
however it gained footing, he was serious;—he was all
uniformity;—he was systematical, and, like all systematic
reasoners, he would move both heaven and earth, and twist and
torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis. In a word
I repeat it over again;—he was
serious;—and, in consequence of it, he would lose all kind of
patience whenever he saw people, especially of condition, who
should have known better,——as careless and as
indifferent about the name they imposed upon their child,—or
more so, than in the choice of <i>Ponto</i> or <i>Cupid</i> for
their puppy-dog.</p>

<p>This, he would say, look’d ill;—and had, moreover,
this particular aggravation in it, viz. That when once a vile name
was wrongfully or injudiciously given, ’twas not like the
case of a man’s character, which, when wrong’d, might
hereafter be cleared;——and, possibly, some time or
other, if not in the man’s life, at least after his
death,—be, somehow or other, set to rights with the world:
But the injury of this, he would say, could never be
undone;—nay, he doubted even whether an act of parliament
could reach it:——He knew as well as you, that the
legislature assumed a power over surnames;—but for very
strong reasons, which he could give, it had never yet adventured, he would say, to go a step
farther.</p>

<p>It was observable, that tho’ my father, in consequence of
this opinion, had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and
dislikings towards certain names;—that there were still
numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him,
that they were absolutely indifferent to him. <i>Jack, Dick</i>,
and <i>Tom</i> were of this class: These my father called neutral
names;—affirming of them, without a satire, That there had
been as many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men,
since the world began, who had indifferently borne them;—so
that, like equal forces acting against each other in contrary
directions, he thought they mutually destroyed each other’s
effects; for which reason, he would often declare, He would not
give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them. <i>Bob</i>, which was
my brother’s name, was another of these neutral kinds of
christian names, which operated very little either way; and as my
father happen’d to be at <i>Epsom</i>, when it was given him,—he would
oft-times thank Heaven it was no worse. <i>Andrew</i> was something
like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;—’twas
worse, he said, than nothing.—<i>William</i> stood pretty
high:——<i>Numps</i> again was low with him:—and
<i>Nick</i>, he said, was the D<small>EVIL.</small></p>

<p>
But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for
T<small>RISTRAM</small>;—he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion
of it of any thing in the world,—thinking it could possibly produce
nothing in <i>rerum natura</i>, but what was extremely mean and pitiful: So
that in the midst of a dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was
frequently involved,——he would sometimes break off in a sudden and
spirited E<small>PIPHONEMA</small>, or rather E<small>ROTESIS</small>, raised a
third, and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the
discourse,——and demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether
he would take upon him to say, he had ever remembered,——whether he
had ever read,—or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, called
<i>Tristram</i>, performing any thing great or worth
recording?—No,—he would
say,—T<small>RISTRAM</small>!—The thing is impossible.
</p>

<p>What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to
publish this notion of his to the world? Little boots it to the
subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinions,—unless he
gives them proper vent:—It was the identical thing which my
father did:—for in the year sixteen, which was two years
before I was born, he was at the pains of writing an express
D<small>ISSERTATION</small> simply upon the word
<i>Tristram</i>,—shewing the world, with great candour and
modesty, the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name.</p>

<p>When this story is compared with the title-page,—Will not
the gentle reader pity my father from his soul?—to see an
orderly and well-disposed gentleman, who tho’
singular,—yet inoffensive in his notions,—so played
upon in them by cross purposes;——to look down upon
the stage, and see him baffled and overthrown in all his
little systems and wishes; to behold a train of events perpetually
falling out against him, and in so critical and cruel a way, as if
they had purposedly been plann’d and pointed against him,
merely to insult his speculations.——In a word, to
behold such a one, in his old age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten
times in a day suffering sorrow;—ten times in a day calling
the child of his prayers T<small>RISTRAM</small>!—Melancholy
dissyllable of sound! which, to his ears, was unison to
<i>Nincompoop</i>, and every name vituperative under
heaven.——By his ashes! I swear it,—if ever
malignant spirit took pleasure, or busied itself in traversing the
purposes of mortal man,—it must have been here;—and if
it was not necessary I should be born before I was christened, I
would this moment give the reader an account of it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XX</small>
</h3>

<p>——How could you, Madam, be so
inattentive in reading the last chapter? I told you in it, <i>That my mother was not a
papist.</i>——Papist! You told me no such thing,
Sir.—Madam, I beg leave to repeat it over again, that I told
you as plain, at least, as words, by direct inference, could tell
you such a thing.—Then, Sir, I must have miss’d a
page.—No, Madam, you have not miss’d a word.—Then
I was asleep, Sir.—My pride, Madam, cannot allow you that
refuge.—Then, I declare, I know nothing at all about the
matter.—That, Madam, is the very fault I lay to your charge;
and as a punishment for it, I do insist upon it, that you
immediately turn back, that is as soon as you get to the next full
stop, and read the whole chapter over again. I have imposed this
penance upon the lady, neither out of wantonness nor cruelty; but
from the best of motives; and therefore shall make her no apology
for it when she returns back:—’Tis to rebuke a vicious
taste, which has crept into thousands besides herself,—of
reading straight forwards, more in quest of the adventures, than of the deep erudition
and knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it should
be, would infallibly impart with them——The mind should
be accustomed to make wise reflections, and draw curious
conclusions as it goes along; the habitude of which made
<i>Pliny</i> the younger affirm, “That he never read a
book so bad, but he drew some profit from it.” The stories of
<i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>, run over without this turn and
application,—do less service, I affirm it, than the history
of <i>Parismus</i> and <i>Parismenus</i>, or of the Seven Champions
of <i>England</i>, read with it.</p>

<p>
———But here comes my fair lady. Have you read over again the
chapter, Madam, as I desired you?—You have: And did you not observe the
passage, upon the second reading, which admits the inference?—Not a word
like it! Then, Madam, be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the
chapter, where I take upon me to say, “It was <i>necessary</i> I should
be born before I was christen’d.” Had my mother, Madam, been a
Papist, that consequence did not follow.<a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine, but more
so to the Republick of letters;—so that my own is quite
swallowed up in the consideration of it,—that this self-same
vile pruriency for fresh adventures in all things, has got so strongly into our habit and humour,—and so
wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our
concupiscence that way,—that nothing but the gross and more
carnal parts of a composition will go down:—The subtle hints
and sly communications of science fly off, like spirits
upwards,—the heavy moral escapes downwards; and both the one
and the other are as much lost to the world, as if they were still
left in the bottom of the ink-horn.</p>

<p>I wish the male-reader has not pass’d by many a one, as
quaint and curious as this one, in which the female-reader has been
detected. I wish it may have its effects;—and that all good
people, both male and female, from example, may be taught to think
as well as read.</p>

<i>L<small>E</small> Conseil estime, que la question proposée souffre de
grandes difficultés. Les Théologiens posent d’un côté pour principe, que
le baptême, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance;
il faut être né dans le monde, pour renaître en</i> Jesus Christ,
<i>comme ils l’enseignent. S.</i> Thomas, 3 part. quæst. 88 artic. 11.
<i>suit cette doctrine comme une verité constante; l’on ne peut, dit ce
S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui sont renférmes dans le sein de leurs meres,
&amp; S.</i> Thomas <i>est fondé sur ce, que les enfans ne sont point nés,
&amp; ne peuvent être comptés parmi les autres hommes; d’où il
conclud, qu’ils ne peuvent être l’objet d’une action
extérieure, pour reçevoir par leur ministére, les sacremens nécessaires au
salut:</i> Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut
cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant; unde non possunt subjici actioni humanæ, ut

considerant d’un côté, que le raisonnement des théologiens est uniquement
fondé sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose
que l’on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermés dans
le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp;
d’un autre côté, considerant que lés mêmes théologiens enseignent, que

suivant lequel on assure avoir trouvé un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans

l’on pourroit se servir du moyen proposé, dans la confiance qu’il
a, que Dieu n’a point laissé ces sortes d’enfans sans aucuns
secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est exposé, que le moyen dont il
s’agit est propre à leur procurer le baptême; cependant comme il
s’agiroit, en autorisant la pratique proposée, de changer une regle
universellement établie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit
s’addresser à son evêque, &amp; à qui il appartient de juger de
l’utilité, &amp; du danger du moyen proposé, &amp; comme, sous le bon
plaisir de l’evêque, le Conseil estime qu’il faudroit recourir au
Pape, qui a le droit d’expliquer les régles de l’eglise, &amp;
d’y déroger dans le cas, ou la loi ne sçauroit obliger, quelque sage
&amp; quelque utile que paroisse la maniére de baptiser dont il s’agit,
le Conseil ne pourroit l’approver sans le concours de ces deux autorités.
On conseile au moins à celui qui consulte, de s’addresser à son evêque,
&amp; de lui faire part de la presente décision, afin que, si le prelat entre
dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignés s’appuyent, il
puisse être autorisé dans le cas de nécessité, ou il risqueroit trop
d’attendre que la permission fût demandée &amp; accordée d’employer
le moyen qu’il propose si avantageux au salut de l’enfant. Au
reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l’on pourroit s’en servir, croit
cependant, que si les enfans dont il s’agit, venoient au monde, contre
l’esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du méme moyen, il seroit
nécessaire de les baptiser</i> sous condition; <i>&amp; en cela le Conseil se
conforme à tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le baptême d’un enfant qui
fait paroître quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent néantmoins, &amp;
ordonnent de le baptiser</i> sous condition, <i>s’il vient heureusement
au monde.</i>

rested well the night after so tiresome a consultation.—He
begs to know, whether after the ceremony of marriage, and before
that of consummation, the baptizing all the

would not be a shorter and safer cut still; on condition, as above,
That if the H<small>OMUNCULI</small> do well, and come safe into

again (<i>sous condition</i>)——And provided, in the

apprehends it may, <i>par le moyen d’une</i> petite canulle,
and <i>sans faire aucune tort au pere.</i></p>

The <i>Romish</i> Rituals direct the baptizing of the child, in cases of

the Doctors of the <i>Sorbonne</i>, by a deliberation held amongst them,

determining, That though no part of the child’s body should
appear,—that baptism shall, nevertheless, be administered to it by
injection,—<i>par le moyen d’une petite canulle</i>,—Anglicè

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXI</small>
</h3>

<p>——I <small>WONDER</small> what’s
all that noise, and running backwards and forwards for, above
stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour and a
half’s silence, to my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——who,
you must know, was sitting on the opposite side of the fire,
smoaking his social pipe all the time, in mute contemplation of a
new pair of black plush-breeches which he had got on:—What
can they be doing, brother?—quoth my father,—we can
scarce hear ourselves talk.</p>

<p>I think, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, taking his pipe from his
mouth, and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail
of his left thumb, as he began his sentence,——I think,
says he:——But to enter rightly into my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s sentiments upon this matter, you must be made
to enter first a little into his character, the out-lines of which
I shall just give you, and then the dialogue between
him and my father will go on as well again.</p>

<p>Pray what was that man’s name,—for I write in such a
hurry, I have no time to recollect or look for it,——who
first made the observation, “That there was great
inconstancy in our air and climate?” Whoever he was,
’twas a just and good observation in him.—But the
corollary drawn from it, namely, “That it is this which
has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical
characters;”—that was not his;—it was found out
by another man, at least a century and a half after him: Then
again,—that this copious store-house of original materials,
is the true and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better
than those of <i>France</i>, or any others that either have, or can
be wrote upon the Continent:——that discovery was not
fully made till about the middle of King <i>William</i>’s
reign,—when the great <i>Dryden</i>, in writing one of his
long prefaces, (if I mistake not) most fortunately hit upon it. Indeed toward the
latter end of queen <i>Anne</i>, the great <i>Addison</i> began to
patronize the notion, and more fully explained it to the world in
one or two of his Spectators;—but the discovery was not
his.—Then, fourthly and lastly, that this strange
irregularity in our climate, producing so strange an irregularity
in our characters,——doth thereby, in some sort, make us
amends, by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the
weather will not suffer us to go out of doors,—that
observation is my own;—and was struck out by me this very
rainy day, <i>March</i> 26, 1759, and betwixt the hours of nine and
ten in the morning.</p>

<p>
Thus—thus, my fellow-labourers and associates in this great harvest of
our learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus it is, by slow steps of casual
increase, that our knowledge physical, metaphysical, physiological, polemical,
nautical, mathematical, ænigmatical, technical, biographical, romantical,
chemical, and obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it, (most of ’em
ending as these do, in <i>ical</i>) have for these two last centuries and more,
gradually been creeping upwards towards that Ἀκμὴ of their perfections, from
which, if we may form a conjecture from the advances of these last seven years,
we cannot possibly be far off.
</p>

<p>When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all
kind of writings whatsoever;—the want of all kind of writing
will put an end to all kind of reading;—and that in time,
<i>As war begets poverty; poverty peace</i>,——must, in
course, put an end to all kind of knowledge,—and
then——we shall have all to begin over again; or, in
other words, be exactly where we started.</p>

<p>———Happy! Thrice happy times! I only wish that
the æra of my begetting, as well as the mode and manner of
it, had been a little alter’d,—or that it could have
been put off, with any convenience to my father or mother, for some
twenty or five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in the literary world might have
stood some chance.——</p>

<p>But I forget my uncle <i>Toby</i>, whom all this while we have
left knocking the ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.</p>

<p>His humour was of that particular species, which does honour to
our atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him
amongst one of the first-rate productions of it, had not there
appeared too many strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which
shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from
blood, than either wind or water, or any modifications or
combinations of them whatever: And I have, therefore, oft-times
wondered, that my father, tho’ I believe he had his reasons
for it, upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity, in my
course, when I was a boy,—should never once endeavour to
account for them in this way: for all the S<small>HANDY</small>
F<small>AMILY</small> were of an original character
throughout:——I mean the males,—the females had no
character at all,—except, indeed, my great aunt
D<small>INAH</small>, who, about sixty years ago, was married and got with child by the coachman,
for which my father, according to his hypothesis of christian
names, would often say, She might thank her godfathers and
godmothers.</p>

<p>It will seem strange,——and I would as soon think of
dropping a riddle in the reader’s way, which is not my
interest to do, as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass,
that an event of this kind, so many years after it had happened,
should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity,
which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my father and my
uncle <i>Toby.</i> One would have thought, that the whole force of
the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at
first,—as is generally the case.—But nothing ever
wrought with our family after the ordinary way. Possibly at the
very time this happened, it might have something else to afflict
it; and as afflictions are sent down for our good, and that as this
had never done the S<small>HANDY</small> F<small>AMILY</small> any
good at all, it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an
opportunity to discharge its office.——Observe, I
determine nothing upon this.——My way is ever to point
out to the curious, different tracts of investigation, to come at
the first springs of the events I tell;—not with a pedantic
<i>Fescue</i>,—or in the decisive manner or <i>Tacitus</i>,
who outwits himself and his reader;—but with the officious
humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the
inquisitive;—to them I write,——and by them I
shall be read,——if any such reading as this could be
supposed to hold out so long,—to the very end of the
world.</p>

<p>Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my
father and uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what
direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of
dissatisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I
am able to explain with great exactness, and is as follows:</p>

<p>My uncle T<small>OBY</small> S<small>HANDY</small>, Madam, was a
gentleman, who, with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of
honour and rectitude,—possessed one in a very eminent degree,
which is seldom or never put into the catalogue; and that was a
most extreme and unparallel’d modesty of
nature;——though I correct the word nature, for this
reason, that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to
a hearing, and that is, Whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquir’d.——Whichever way my uncle <i>Toby</i>
came by it, ’twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of
it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so
unhappy as to have very little choice in them,—but to
things;——and this kind of modesty so possessed him, and
it arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if such a
thing could be, even the modesty of a woman: That female nicety,
Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which
makes you so much the awe of ours.</p>

<p>You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> had
contracted all this from this very source;—that he had spent a great
part of his time in converse with your sex, and that from a
thorough knowledge of you, and the force of imitation which such
fair examples render irresistible, he had acquired this amiable
turn of mind.</p>

<p>I wish I could say so,—for unless it was with his
sister-in-law, my father’s wife and my mother——my
uncle <i>Toby</i> scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as
many years;——no, he got it, Madam, by a
blow.——A blow!—Yes, Madam, it was owing to a
blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from the parapet of a
horn-work at the siege of Namur, which struck full upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s groin.—Which way could that effect it?
The story of that, Madam, is long and interesting;—but it
would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you
here.——’Tis for an episode hereafter; and every
circumstance relating to it, in its proper place, shall be
faithfully laid before you:—’Till then, it is not in my
power to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what I have said
already,——That my uncle <i>Toby</i> was a gentleman of
unparallel’d modesty, which happening to be somewhat
subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family
pride,——they both so wrought together within him, that
he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt
D<small>INAH</small> touch’d upon, but with the greatest
emotion.——The least hint of it was enough to make the
blood fly into his face;—but when my father enlarged upon the
story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his hypothesis
frequently obliged him to do,—the unfortunate blight of one
of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s honour and modesty o’bleeding; and he
would often take my father aside, in the greatest concern
imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give him any
thing in the world, only to let the story rest.</p>

<p>My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done any thing in nature,
which one brother in reason could have desir’d of another, to
have made my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s heart easy in this, or any
other point. But this lay out of his power.</p>

<p>——My father, as I told you was a philosopher in
grain,—speculative,—systematical;—and my aunt
D<i>inah</i>’s affair was a matter of as much consequence to
him, as the retrogradation of the planets to
<i>Copernicus</i>:—The backslidings of <i>Venus</i> in her
orbit fortified the <i>Copernican</i> system, called so after his
name; and the backslidings of my aunt <i>Dinah</i> in her orbit,
did the same service in establishing my father’s system,
which, I trust, will for ever hereafter be called the <i>Shandean
System</i>, after his.</p>

<p>In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice
a sense of shame as any man whatever;——and neither he,
nor, I dare say, <i>Copernicus</i>, would have divulged the affair
in either case, or have taken the least notice of it to the world,
but for the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.—<i>Amicus
Plato</i>, my father would say, construing the words to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, as he went along, <i>Amicus Plato</i>; that is,
D<small>INAH</small> was my aunt;—<i>sed magis amica
veritas</i>—but T<small>RUTH</small> is my sister.</p>

<p>This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was
the source of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to
hear the tale of family disgrace recorded,——and the
other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint
at it.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, my uncle <i>Toby</i> would
cry,——and for my sake, and for all our sakes, my dear
brother <i>Shandy</i>,—do let this story of our aunt’s
and her ashes sleep in peace;——how can
you,——how can you have so little feeling and compassion
for the character of our family?——What is the character
of a family to an hypothesis? my father would
reply.——Nay, if you come to that—what is the
life of a family?——The life of a family!—my uncle
<i>Toby</i> would say, throwing himself back in his arm chair, and
lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one
leg——Yes, the life,——my father would say,
maintaining his point. How many thousands of ’em are there
every year that come cast away, (in all civilized countries at
least)——and considered as nothing but common air, in
competition of an hypothesis. In my plain sense of things, my uncle
<i>Toby</i> would answer,—every such instance is downright
M<small>URDER</small>, let who will commit it.——There
lies your mistake, my father would reply;——for, in
<i>Foro Scientiæ</i> there is no such thing as
M<small>URDER</small>,——’tis only
D<small>EATH</small>, brother.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would never offer to answer this by any
other kind of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of
<i>Lillebullero.</i>——You must know it was the usual
channel thro’ which his passions got vent, when any thing
shocked or surprized him:——but especially when any
thing, which he deem’d very absurd, was offered.</p>

<p>As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators
upon them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name
to this particular species of argument.—I here take the
liberty to do it myself, for two reasons. First, That, in order to
prevent all confusion in disputes, it may stand as much
distinguished for ever, from every other species of
argument———as the <i>Argumentum ad Verecundiam,
ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori</i>, or any other argument
whatsoever:——And, secondly, That it may be said by my
children’s children, when my head is laid to
rest,——that their learn’d grandfather’s
head had been busied to as much purpose once, as other
people’s;—That he had invented a name, and generously
thrown it into the T<small>REASURY</small> of the <i>Ars
Logica</i>, for one of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole
science. And, if the end of disputation is more to silence than
convince,—they may add, if they please, to one of the best
arguments too.</p>

<p>I do, therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command,
That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the
<i>Argumentum Fistulatorium</i>, and no other;—and that it rank hereafter with the
<i>Argumentum Baculinum</i> and the <i>Argumentum ad Crumenam</i>,
and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Argumentum Tripodium</i>, which is never used but
by the woman against the man;—and the <i>Argumentum ad
Rem</i>, which, contrarywise, is made use of by the man only
against the woman;—As these two are enough in conscience for
one lecture;——and, moreover, as the one is the best
answer to the other,—let them likewise be kept apart, and be
treated of in a place by themselves.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> learned Bishop <i>Hall</i>, I
mean the famous Dr. <i>Joseph Hall</i>, who was Bishop of
<i>Exeter</i> in King <i>James</i> the First’s reign, tells
us in one of <i>Decads</i>, at the end of his divine art of
meditation, imprinted at <i>London</i>, in the year 1610, by
<i>John Beal</i>, dwelling in <i>Aldersgate-street</i>,
“That it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himself;”——and I
really think it is so.</p>

<p>And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a
masterly kind of a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found
out;—I think it is full as abominable, that a man should lose
the honour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it
rotting in his head.</p>

<p>This is precisely my situation.</p>

<p>For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into,
as in all my digressions (one only excepted) there is a
master-stroke of digressive skill, the merit of which has all
along, I fear, been over-looked by my reader,—not for want of
penetration in him,—but because ’tis an excellence
seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a digression;—and
it is this: That tho’ my digressions are all fair, as you
observe,—and that I fly off from what I am about, as far, and
as often too, as any writer in <i>Great Britain</i>; yet I
constantly take care to order affairs so that my main business does
not stand still in my absence.</p>

<p>I was just going, for example, to have given you the great
out-lines of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s most whimsical
character;—when my aunt <i>Dinah</i> and the coachman came
across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very
heart of the planetary system: Notwithstanding all this, you
perceive that the drawing of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s character
went on gently all the time;—not the great contours of
it,—that was impossible,—but some familiar strokes and
faint designations of it, were here and there touch’d on, as
we went along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle
Toby now than you was before.</p>

<p>By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by
itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and
reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other.
In a word, my work is digressive, and it is progressive
too,—and at the same time.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the
earth’s moving round her axis, in her diurnal rotation,
with her progress in her elliptick orbit which brings
about the year, and constitutes that variety and vicissitude of
seasons we enjoy;—though I own it suggested the
thought,—as I believe the greatest of our boasted
improvements and discoveries have come from such trifling
hints.</p>

<p>Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;——they
are the life, the soul of reading!—take them out of this
book, for instance,—you might as well take the book along
with them;—one cold eternal winter would reign in every page
of it; restore them to the writer;—he steps forth like a
bridegroom,—bids All-hail; brings in variety, and forbids the
appetite to fail.</p>

<p>All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them,
so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of
the author, whose distress, in this matter, is truly pitiable: For,
if he begins a digression,—from that moment, I observe, his
whole work stands stock still;—and if he goes on with his
main work,—then there is an end of his
digression.</p>

<p>——This is vile work.—For which reason, from
the beginning of this, you see, I have constructed the main work
and the adventitious parts of it with such intersections, and have
so complicated and involved the digressive and progressive
movements, one wheel within another, that the whole machine, in
general, has been kept a-going;—and, what’s more, it
shall be kept a-going these forty years, if it pleases the fountain
of health to bless me so long with life and good spirits.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAVE</small> a strong propensity in me to
begin this chapter very nonsensically, and I will not balk my
fancy.—Accordingly I set off thus:</p>

<p>If the fixture of <i>Momus</i>’s glass in the human
breast, according to the proposed emendation of that arch-critick,
had taken place,——first, This foolish
consequence would certainly have followed,—That the very
wisest and very gravest of us all, in one coin or other, must have
paid window-money every day of our lives.</p>

<p>And, secondly, that had the said glass been there set up,
nothing more would have been wanting, in order to have taken a
man’s character, but to have taken a chair and gone softly,
as you would to a dioptrical bee-hive, and look’d
in,—view’d the soul stark naked;—observed all her
motions,—her machinations;—traced all her maggots from
their first engendering to their crawling forth;—watched her
loose in her frisks, her gambols, her capricios; and after some
notice of her more solemn deportment, consequent upon such frisks,
&amp;c.——then taken your pen and ink and set down
nothing but what you had seen, and could have sworn to:—But
this is an advantage not to be had by the biographer in this
planet;—in the planet <i>Mercury</i> (belike) it may be so,
if not better still for him;——for there the intense heat of the country, which is proved by computators,
from its vicinity to the sun, to be more than equal to that of
red-hot iron,—must, I think, long ago have vitrified the
bodies of the inhabitants, (as the efficient cause) to suit them
for the climate (which is the final cause;) so that betwixt them
both, all the tenements of their souls, from top to bottom, may be
nothing else, for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the
contrary, but one fine transparent body of clear glass (bating the
umbilical knot)—so that, till the inhabitants grow old and
tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of light, in passing through
them, become so monstrously refracted,——or return
reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye,
that a man cannot be seen through;—his soul might as well,
unless for mere ceremony, or the trifling advantage which the
umbilical point gave her,—might, upon all other accounts, I
say, as well play the fool out o’doors as in her own
house.</p>

<p>But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of
this earth;—our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt
up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so
that, if we would come to the specific characters of them, we must
go some other way to work.</p>

<p>Many, in good truth, are the ways, which human wit has been
forced to take, to do this thing with exactness.</p>

<p>Some, for instance, draw all their characters with
wind-instruments.—<i>Virgil</i> takes notice of that way in
the affair of <i>Dido</i> and <i>Æneas</i>;—but it is
as fallacious as the breath of fame;—and, moreover, bespeaks
a narrow genius. I am not ignorant that the <i>Italians</i> pretend
to a mathematical exactness in their designations of one particular
sort of character among them, from the <i>forte</i> or <i>piano</i>
of a certain wind-instrument they use,—which they say is
infallible.—I dare not mention the name of the instrument in
this place;—’tis sufficient we have it amongst
us,—but never think of making a drawing by it;—this is
ænigmatical, and intended to be so, at least <i>ad
populum</i>:—And therefore, I beg, Madam, when you come here, that
you read on as fast as you can, and never stop to make any inquiry
about it.</p>

<p>There are others again, who will draw a man’s character
from no other helps in the world, but merely from his
evacuations;—but this often gives a very incorrect
outline,—unless, indeed, you take a sketch of his repletions
too; and by correcting one drawing from the other, compound one
good figure out of them both.</p>

<p>I should have no objection to this method, but that I think it
must smell too strong of the lamp,—and be render’d
still more operose, by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of
his <i>Non-naturals.</i>—Why the most natural actions of a
man’s life should be called his Non-naturals,—is
another question.</p>

<p>
There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these
expedients;—not from any fertility of their own, but from the various
ways of doing it, which they have borrowed from the honourable devices which
the Pentagraphic Brethren<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> of the brush have shewn in taking
copies.—These, you must know, are your great historians.
</p>

<p>One of these you will see drawing a full length character
<i>against the light</i>;—that’s
illiberal,—dishonest,—and hard upon the character of
the man who sits.</p>

<p>Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the
<i>Camera</i>;—that is most unfair of all, because,
<i>there</i> you are sure to be represented in some of your most
ridiculous attitudes.</p>

<p>To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s character, I am determined to draw it by
no mechanical help whatever;—nor shall my pencil be guided by
any one wind-instrument which ever was blown upon, either on this,
or on the other side of the <i>Alps</i>;—nor will I consider
either his repletions or his discharges,—or touch upon his
Non-naturals; but, in a word, I will draw my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s character from his

</h3>

<p>I<small>F</small> I was not morally sure that the
reader must be out of all patience for my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
character,——I would here previously have convinced him
that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as
that which I have pitch’d upon.</p>

<p>A man and his H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>,
tho’ I cannot say that they act and re-act exactly after the
same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other: Yet
doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind; and
my opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the
manner of electrified bodies,—and that, by means of the
heated parts of the rider, which come immediately into contact with
the back of the H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>,—by
long journies and much friction, it so happens, that the body of
the rider is at length fill’d as full of
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSICAL</small> matter as it can
hold;—so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature
of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and
character of the other.</p>

<p>Now the H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> which my uncle
<i>Toby</i> always rode upon, was in my opinion an
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> well worth giving a
description of, if it was only upon the score of his great
singularity;—for you might have travelled from <i>York</i> to
<i>Dover</i>,—from <i>Dover</i> to <i>Penzance</i> in
<i>Cornwall</i>, and from <i>Penzance</i> to <i>York</i> back
again, and not have seen such another upon the road; or if you had
seen such a one, whatever haste you had been in, you must
infallibly have stopp’d to have taken a view of him. Indeed,
the gait and figure of him was so strange, and so utterly unlike
was he, from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole species,
that it was now and then made a matter of
dispute,——whether he was really a
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> or no: But as the
Philosopher would use no other argument to the Sceptic, who
disputed with him against the reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs, and walking
across the room;—so would my uncle <i>Toby</i> use no other
argument to prove his H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> was
a H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> indeed, but by getting
upon his back and riding him about;—leaving the world, after
that, to determine the point as it thought fit.</p>

<p>In good truth, my uncle <i>Toby</i> mounted him with so much
pleasure, and he carried my uncle <i>Toby</i> so
well,——that he troubled his head very little with what
the world either said or thought about it.</p>

<p>It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of
him:—But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me
leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle <i>Toby</i> came by
him.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXV</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> wound in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s groin, which he received at the siege of
<i>Namur</i>, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought
expedient he should return to <i>England</i>, in order, if
possible, to be set to rights.</p>

<p>He was four years totally confined,—part of it to his bed,
and all of it to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was
all that time in hand, suffer’d unspeakable
miseries,—owing to a succession of exfoliations from the
<i>os pubis</i>, and the outward edge of that part of the
<i>coxendix</i> called the <i>os illium</i>,——both
which bones were dismally crush’d, as much by the
irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the
parapet,—as by its size,—(tho’ it was pretty
large) which inclined the surgeon all along to think, that the
great injury which it had done my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s groin,
was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself, than to the
projectile force of it,—which he would often tell him was a
great happiness.</p>

<p>My father at that time was just beginning business in
<i>London</i>, and had taken a house;—and as the truest
friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two
brothers,—and that my father thought my uncle <i>Toby</i> could no where be so well nursed
and taken care of as in his own house,——he
assign’d him the very best apartment in it.—And what
was a much more sincere mark of his affection still, he would never
suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any
occasion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead him up stairs
to see his brother <i>Toby</i>, and chat an hour by his
bed-side.</p>

<p>The history of a soldier’s wound beguiles the pain of
it;—my uncle’s visitors at least thought so, and in
their daily calls upon him, from the courtesy arising out of that
belief, they would frequently turn the discourse to that
subject,—and from that subject the discourse would generally
roll on to the siege itself.</p>

<p>These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle
<i>Toby</i> received great relief from them, and would have
received much more, but that they brought him into some unforeseen
perplexities, which, for three months together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit upon an
expedient to extricate himself out of them, I verily believe they
would have laid him in his grave.</p>

<p>What these perplexities of my uncle <i>Toby</i>
were,——’tis impossible for you to guess;—if
you could,—I should blush; not as a relation,—not as a
man,—nor even as a woman,—but I should blush as an
author; inasmuch as I set no small store by myself upon this very
account, that my reader has never yet been able to guess at any
thing. And in this, Sir, I am of so nice and singular a humour,
that if I thought you was able to form the least judgment or
probable conjecture to yourself, of what was to come in the next
page,—I would tear it out of my book.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAVE</small> begun a new book, on purpose
that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the
perplexities in which my uncle <i>Toby</i> was involved, from the many discourses and interrogations about the
siege of <i>Namur</i>, where he received his wound.</p>

<p>I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of
King <i>William</i>’s wars,—but if he has not,—I
then inform him, that one of the most memorable attacks in that
siege, was that which was made by the <i>English</i> and
<i>Dutch</i> upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, between
the gate of <i>St. Nicolas</i>, which inclosed the great sluice or
water-stop, where the <i>English</i> were terribly exposed to the
shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion of <i>St. Roch</i>: The
issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this; That the
<i>Dutch</i> lodged themselves upon the counter-guard,—and
that the <i>English</i> made themselves masters of the covered-way
before <i>St. Nicolas</i>-gate, notwithstanding the gallantry of
the <i>French</i> officers, who exposed themselves upon the glacis
sword in hand.</p>

<p>As this was the principal attack of which my uncle <i>Toby</i>
was an eye-witness at <i>Namur</i>,——the army of the
besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of the <i>Maes</i>
and <i>Sambre</i>, from seeing much of each other’s
operations,——my uncle <i>Toby</i> was generally more
eloquent and particular in his account of it; and the many
perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable
difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving
such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the
scarp and counterscarp,—the glacis and covered-way,—the
half-moon and ravelin,—as to make his company fully
comprehend where and what he was about.</p>

<p>Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that
you will the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and
in opposition to many misconceptions, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> did
oft-times puzzle his visitors, and sometimes himself too.</p>

<p>To speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs
were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle <i>Toby</i> was in one of
his explanatory moods, ’twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the
discourse free from obscurity.</p>

<p>What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, was this,—that in the attack of the
counterscarp, before the gate of <i>St. Nicolas</i>, extending
itself from the bank of the <i>Maes</i>, quite up to the great
water-stop,—the ground was cut and cross cut with such a
multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all
sides,—and he would get so sadly bewildered, and set fast
amongst them, that frequently he could neither get backwards or
forwards to save his life; and was oft-times obliged to give up the
attack upon that very account only.</p>

<p>These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle <i>Toby Shandy</i> more
perturbations than you would imagine; and as my father’s
kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh
enquirers,——he had but a very uneasy task of it.</p>

<p>No doubt my uncle <i>Toby</i> had great command of himself,—and could guard
appearances, I believe, as well as most men;—yet any one may
imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without
getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered-way without
falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without danger of
slipping into the ditch, but that he must have fretted and fumed
inwardly:—He did so;—and the little and hourly
vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who
has not read <i>Hippocrates</i>, yet, whoever has read
<i>Hippocrates</i>, or Dr. <i>James Mackenzie</i>, and has
considered well the effects which the passions and affections of
the mind have upon the digestion—(Why not of a wound as well
as of a dinner?)—may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and
exacerbations of his wound my uncle <i>Toby</i> must have undergone
upon that score only.</p>

<p>—My uncle <i>Toby</i> could not philosophize upon
it;—’twas enough he felt it was so,—and having
sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together, he was resolved some way or other to extricate
himself.</p>

<p>
He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature of
the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position, when a
thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and have it
pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortification of the town and
citadel of <i>Namur</i>, with its environs, it might be a means of giving him
ease.—I take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the
town and citadel, for this reason,—because my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
wound was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the returning
angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of
<i>St. Roch</i>:——so that he was pretty confident he could stick a
pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing on when the stone
struck him.
</p>

<p>All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a
world of sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy means, as you will read, of procuring my
uncle <i>Toby</i> his H<small>OBBY-HORSE.</small></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> is nothing so foolish, when you
are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind, as to
order things so badly, as to let your criticks and gentry of
refined taste run it down: Nor is there any thing so likely to make
them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or, what is
full as offensive, of bestowing your attention upon the rest of
your guests in so particular a way, as if there was no such thing
as a critick (by occupation) at table.</p>

<p>——I guard against both; for, in the first place, I
have left half a dozen places purposely open for them;—and in
the next place, I pay them all court.—Gentlemen, I kiss your
hands, I protest no company could give me half the
pleasure,—by my soul I am glad to see
you———I beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any
ceremony, and fall on heartily.</p>

<p>I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of
carrying my complaisance so far, as to have left a seventh open for
them,—and in this very spot I stand on; but being told by a
Critick (tho’ not by occupation,—but by nature) that I
had acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up directly,
hoping, in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great deal
of more room next year.</p>

<p>———How, in the name of wonder! could your
uncle <i>Toby</i>, who, it seems, was a military man, and whom you
have represented as no fool,—be at the same time such a
confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed, fellow, as—Go
look.</p>

<p>So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn
it.—’Tis language unurbane,—and only befitting
the man who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things,
or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and
confusion. It is moreover the reply valiant—and therefore I reject it; for tho’ it
might have suited my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s character as a
soldier excellently well,—and had he not accustomed himself,
in such attacks, to whistle the <i>Lillabullero</i>, as he wanted
no courage, ’tis the very answer he would have given; yet it
would by no means have done for me. You see as plain as can be,
that I write as a man of erudition;—that even my similies, my
allusions, my illustrations, my metaphors, are erudite,—and
that I must sustain my character properly, and contrast it properly
too,—else what would become of me? Why, Sir, I should be
undone;—at this very moment that I am going here to fill up
one place against a critick,—I should have made an opening
for a couple.</p>

<p>——Therefore I answer thus:</p>

<p>Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you
ever read such a book as <i>Locke</i>’s Essay upon the Human
Understanding?——Don’t answer me
rashly—because many, I know, quote the book, who have not
read it—and many have read it who understand it not:—If
either of these is your case, as I write to instruct, I will tell
you in three words what the book is.—It is a history.—A
history! of who? what? where? when? Don’t hurry
yourself—It is a history-book, Sir, (which may possibly
recommend it to the world) of what passes in a man’s own
mind; and if you will say so much of the book, and no more, believe
me, you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysick
circle.</p>

<p>But this by the way.</p>

<p>Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into
the bottom of this matter, it will be found that the cause of
obscurity and confusion, in the mind of a man, is threefold.</p>

<p>Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place. Secondly, slight and
transient impressions made by the objects, when the said organs are
not dull. And thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to
retain what it has received.—Call down <i>Dolly</i> your
chamber-maid, and I will give you my cap and bell along with it, if
I make not this matter so plain that <i>Dolly</i> herself
should understand it as well as <i>Malbranch.</i>——When
<i>Dolly</i> has indited her epistle to <i>Robin</i>, and has
thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right
side;—take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and
faculties of perception can, by nothing in this world, be so aptly
typified and explained as by that one thing which
<i>Dolly</i>’s hand is in search of.—Your organs are
not so dull that I should inform you—’tis an inch, Sir,
of red seal-wax.</p>

<p>When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if <i>Dolly</i>
fumbles too long for her thimble, till the wax is over hardened, it
will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse
which was wont to imprint it. Very well. If <i>Dolly</i>’s
wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper too
soft,—tho’ it may receive,—it will not hold the
impression, how hard soever <i>Dolly</i> thrusts against it; and
last of all, supposing the wax good, and eke the thimble, but
applied thereto in careless haste, as her Mistress rings the bell;——in any one of
these three cases the print left by the thimble will be as unlike
the prototype as a brass-jack.</p>

<p>Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause
of the confusion in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s discourse; and it
is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long, after the
manner of great physiologists—to shew the world, what it did
<i>not</i> arise from.</p>

<p>What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile
source of obscurity it is,—and ever will be,—and that
is the unsteady uses of words, which have perplexed the clearest
and most exalted understandings.</p>

<p>It is ten to one (at <i>Arthur</i>’s) whether you have
ever read the literary histories of past ages;—if you have,
what terrible battles, ’yclept logomachies, have they
occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and
ink-shed,—that a good-natured man cannot read the accounts of
them without tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>Gentle critick! when thou hast weighed all this, and considered within thyself how much
of thy own knowledge, discourse, and conversation has been pestered
and disordered, at one time or other, by this, and this
only:—What a pudder and racket in C<small>OUNCILS</small>
about χδια and
υωοςασις; and
in the S<small>CHOOLS</small> of the learned about power and about
spirit;—about essences, and about
quintessences;——about substances, and about
space.——What confusion in greater
T<small>HEATRES</small> from words of little meaning, and as
indeterminate a sense! when thou considerest this, thou wilt not
wonder at my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s perplexities,—thou
wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his
counterscarp;—his glacis and his covered way;—his
ravelin and his half- moon: ’Twas not by ideas,—by
Heaven; his life was put in jeopardy by words.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> got his map
of <i>Namur</i> to his mind, he began immediately to apply himself,
and with the utmost diligence, to the study of it; for
nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery, and his
recovery depending, as you have read, upon the passions and
affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nicest care to
make himself so far master of his subject, as to be able to talk
upon it without emotion.</p>

<p>In a fortnight’s close and painful application, which, by
the bye, did my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s wound, upon his groin, no
good,—he was enabled, by the help of some marginal documents
at the feet of the elephant, together with <i>Gobesius</i>’s
military architecture and pyroballogy, translated from the
<i>Flemish</i>, to form his discourse with passable perspicuity;
and before he was two full months gone,—he was right eloquent
upon it, and could make not only the attack of the advanced
counterscarp with great order;—but having, by that time, gone
much deeper into the art, than what his first motive made
necessary, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was able to cross the <i>Maes</i>
and <i>Sambre</i>; make diversions as far as <i>Vauban</i>’s
line, the abbey of <i>Salsines</i>, &amp;c. and give his visitors
as distinct a history of each of their attacks, as of that of the
gate of <i>St. Nicolas</i>, where he had the honour to receive his
wound.</p>

<p>But desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases
ever with the acquisition of it. The more my uncle <i>Toby</i>
pored over his map, the more he took a liking to it!—by the
same process and electrical assimilation, as I told you, through
which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves, by long friction
and incumbition, have the happiness, at length, to get all
be-virtu’d—be-pictured,—be-butterflied, and
be-fiddled.</p>

<p>The more my uncle <i>Toby</i> drank of this sweet fountain of
science, the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so
that before the first year of his confinement had well gone round,
there was scarce a fortified town in <i>Italy</i> or
<i>Flanders</i>, of which, by one means or other, he had not
procured a plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating therewith the histories of their sieges,
their demolitions, their improvements, and new works, all which he
would read with that intense application and delight, that he would
forget himself, his wound, his confinement, his dinner.</p>

<p>In the second year my uncle <i>Toby</i> purchased <i>Ramelli</i>
and <i>Cataneo</i>, translated from the
<i>Italian</i>;—likewise <i>Stevinus, Moralis</i>, the
Chevalier <i>de Ville, Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter</i>, the Count
<i>de Pagan</i>, the Marshal <i>Vauban</i>, Mons. <i>Blondel</i>,
with almost as many more books of military architecture, as Don
<i>Quixote</i> was found to have of chivalry, when the curate and
barber invaded his library.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in
<i>August</i>, ninety-nine, my uncle <i>Toby</i> found it necessary
to understand a little of projectiles:—and having judged it
best to draw his knowledge from the fountain-head, he began with
<i>N. Tartaglia</i>, who it seems was the first man who detected
the imposition of a cannon-ball’s doing all that mischief under the notion of a right line—This
<i>N. Tartaglia</i> proved to my uncle <i>Toby</i> to be an
impossible thing.</p>

<p>——Endless is the search of Truth.</p>

<p>No sooner was my uncle <i>Toby</i> satisfied which road the
cannon-ball did not go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved
in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go: For
which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old
<i>Maltus</i>, and studied him devoutly.—He proceeded next to
<i>Galileo</i> and <i>Torricellius</i>, wherein, by certain
Geometrical rules, infallibly laid down, he found the precise path
to be a P<small>ARABOLA</small>—or else an
H<small>YPERBOLA</small>,—and that the parameter, or <i>latus
rectum</i>, of the conic section of the said path, was to the
quantity and amplitude in a direct <i>ratio</i>, as the whole line
to the sine of double the angle of incidence, formed by the breech
upon an horizontal plane;—and that the
semiparameter,——stop! my dear uncle
<i>Toby</i>——stop!—go not one foot farther into
this thorny and bewildered track,—intricate are the steps!
intricate are the mazes of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles
which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom
K<small>NOWLEDGE</small> will bring upon thee.—O my
uncle;—fly—fly,—fly from it as from a
serpent.——Is it fit——goodnatured man! thou
should’st sit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights
baking thy blood with hectic watchings?——Alas!
’twill exasperate thy symptoms,—check thy
perspirations—evaporate thy spirits—waste thy animal
strength, dry up thy radical moisture, bring thee into a costive
habit of body,——impair thy health,——and
hasten all the infirmities of thy old age.—O my uncle! my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>WOULD</small> not give a groat for that
man’s knowledge in pen-craft, who does not understand
this,——That the best plain narrative in the world,
tacked very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——would have felt both cold and vapid upon
the reader’s palate;—therefore I forthwith put an end to the
chapter, though I was in the middle of my story.</p>

<p>——Writers of my stamp have one principle in common
with painters. Where an exact copying makes our pictures less
striking, we choose the less evil; deeming it even more pardonable
to trespass against truth, than beauty. This is to be understood
<i>cum grano salis</i>; but be it as it will,—as the parallel
is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool, than any
thing else,—’tis not very material whether upon any
other score the reader approves of it or not.</p>

<p>In the latter end of the third year, my uncle <i>Toby</i>
perceiving that the parameter and semi-parameter of the conic
section angered his wound, he left off the study of projectiles in
a kind of a huff, and betook himself to the practical part of
fortification only; the pleasure of which, like a spring held back,
returned upon him with redoubled force.</p>

<p>It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean
shirt,——to dismiss his barber
unshaven,——and to allow his surgeon scarce time
sufficient to dress his wound, concerning himself so little about
it, as not to ask him once in seven times dressing, how it went on:
when, lo!—all of a sudden, for the change was quick as
lightning, he began to sigh heavily for his
recovery,——complained to my father, grew impatient with
the surgeon:——and one morning, as he heard his foot
coming up stairs, he shut up his books, and thrust aside his
instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction
of the cure, which, he told him, might surely have been
accomplished at least by that time:—He dwelt long upon the
miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his four years
melancholy imprisonment;——adding, that had it not been
for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of
brothers,—he had long since sunk under his
misfortunes.——My father was by. My uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s eloquence brought tears into his eyes;——’twas
unexpected:——My uncle <i>Toby</i>, by nature was not
eloquent;—it had the greater effect:——The surgeon
was confounded;——not that there wanted grounds for
such, or greater marks of impatience,—but ’twas
unexpected too; in the four years he had attended him, he had never
seen any thing like it in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s carriage; he
had never once dropped one fretful or discontented
word;——he had been all patience,—all
submission.</p>

<p>—We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing
it;—but we often treble the force:—The surgeon was
astonished; but much more so, when he heard my uncle Toby go on,
and peremptorily insist upon his healing up the wound
directly,—or sending for Monsieur <i>Ronjat</i>, the
king’s serjeant-surgeon, to do it for him.</p>

<p>The desire of life and health is implanted in man’s
nature;——the love of liberty and enlargement is a
sister-passion to it: These my uncle <i>Toby</i> had in common with
his species—and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest
desire to get well and out of doors;——but I have told
you before, that nothing wrought with our family after the common
way;——and from the time and manner in which this eager
desire shewed itself in the present case, the penetrating reader
will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head:——There was so, and
’tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that
cause and crotchet was. I own, when that’s done, ’twill
be time to return back to the parlour fire-side, where we left my
uncle <i>Toby</i> in the middle of his sentence.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXX</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> a man gives himself up to the
government of a ruling passion,—or, in other words, when his
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> grows
headstrong,——farewell cool reason and fair
discretion!</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>’s wound was near well, and as soon as
the surgeon recovered his surprize, and could get leave to say as
much——he told him, ’twas just beginning to
incarnate; and that if no fresh exfoliation happened, which there
was no sign of,—it would be dried up in five or six weeks.
The sound of as many Olympiads, twelve hours before, would have
conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s mind.——The succession of his ideas
was now rapid,—he broiled with impatience to put his design
in execution;——and so, without consulting farther with
any soul living,—which, by the bye, I think is right, when
you are predetermined to take no one soul’s
advice,——he privately ordered <i>Trim</i>, his man, to
pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot-and-four
to be at the door exactly by twelve o’clock that day, when he
knew my father would be upon ’Change.——So leaving
a bank-note upon the table for the surgeon’s care of him, and
a letter of tender thanks for his brother’s—he packed
up his maps, his books of fortification, his instruments, &amp;c.
and by the help of a crutch on one side, and <i>Trim</i> on the
other,——my uncle <i>Toby</i> embarked for
<i>Shandy-Hall.</i></p>

<p>The reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as
follows:</p>

<p>The table in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s room, and at which,
the night before this change happened, he was sitting with his
maps, &amp;c. about him—being somewhat of the smallest, for
that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which
usually lay crowded upon it—he had the accident, in reaching
over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his compasses, and in
stooping to take the compasses up, with his sleeve he threw down
his case of instruments and snuffers;—and as the dice took a
run against him, in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in
falling,——he thrust Monsieur <i>Blondel</i> off the
table, and Count <i>de Pagon</i> o’top of him.</p>

<p>’Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was, to think of redressing these evils by
himself,—he rung his bell for his man
<i>Trim</i>;——<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, prithee see what
confusion I have here been making—I must have some better
contrivance, <i>Trim.</i>—Can’st not thou take my rule,
and measure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and
bespeak me one as big again?——Yes, an’ please
your Honour, replied <i>Trim</i>, making a bow; but I hope your
Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country-seat,
where,—as your Honour takes so much pleasure in
fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.</p>

<p>I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s, who went by the name of <i>Trim</i>, had been
a corporal in my uncle’s own company,—his real name was
<i>James Butler</i>,—but having got the nick-name of
<i>Trim</i>, in the regiment, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, unless when he
happened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any
other name.</p>

<p>The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on
his left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of <i>Landen</i>, which was two years before the affair of
<i>Namur</i>;—and as the fellow was well-beloved in the
regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle <i>Toby</i>
took him for his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending
my uncle <i>Toby</i> in the camp and in his quarters as a valet,
groom, barber, cook, sempster, and nurse; and indeed, from first to
last, waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and
affection.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> loved the man in return, and what attached
him more to him still, was the similitude of their
knowledge.——For Corporal <i>Trim</i>, (for so, for the
future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his
Master’s discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of
prying and peeping continually into his Master’s plans,
&amp;c. exclusive and besides what he gained
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSICALLY</small>, as a body-servant,
<i>Non Hobby Horsical per se</i>;——had become no mean
proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook and
chamber-maid, to know as much of the nature of
strong-holds as my uncle <i>Toby</i> himself.</p>

<p>I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal
<i>Trim</i>’s character,——and it is the only dark
line in it.—The fellow loved to advise,—or rather to
hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly
respectful, ’twas easy to keep him silent when you had him
so; but set his tongue a-going,—you had no hold of
him—he was voluble;—the eternal interlardings of
<i>your Honour</i>, with the respectfulness of Corporal
<i>Trim</i>’s manner, interceding so strong in behalf of his
elocution,—that though you might have been
incommoded,——you could not well be angry. My uncle
<i>Toby</i> was seldom either the one or the other with
him,—or, at least, this fault, in <i>Trim</i>, broke no
squares with them. My uncle <i>Toby</i>, as I said, loved the
man;——and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful
servant,—but as an humble friend,—he could not bear to
stop his mouth.——Such was Corporal <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>If I durst presume, continued <i>Trim</i>, to give
your Honour my advice, and speak my opinion in this
matter.—Thou art welcome, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—speak,——speak what thou thinkest upon
the subject, man, without fear.—Why then, replied
<i>Trim</i>, (not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a
country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead, and
standing erect as before his division,—I think, quoth
<i>Trim</i>, advancing his left, which was his lame leg, a little
forwards,—and pointing with his right hand open towards a map
of <i>Dunkirk</i>, which was pinned against the
hangings,——I think, quoth Corporal <i>Trim</i>, with
humble submission to your Honour’s better
judgment,——that these ravelins, bastions, curtins, and
hornworks, make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle-faddle piece of
work of it here upon paper, compared to what your Honour and I
could make of it were we in the country by ourselves, and had but a
rood, or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with: As
summer is coming on, continued <i>Trim</i>, your Honour might sit out
of doors, and give me the nography—(Call it ichnography,
quoth my uncle,)——of the town or citadel, your Honour
was pleased to sit down before,—and I will be shot by your
Honour upon the glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your
Honour’s mind.——I dare say thou would’st,
<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle.—For if your Honour, continued
the Corporal, could but mark me the polygon, with its exact lines
and angles—That I could do very well, quoth my uncle.—I
would begin with the fossé, and if your Honour could tell me
the proper depth and breadth—I can to a hair’s breadth,
<i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle.—I would throw out the earth
upon this hand towards the town for the scarp,—and on that
hand towards the campaign for the counterscarp.—Very right,
<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>:—And when I had
sloped them to your mind,——an’ please your
Honour, I would face the glacis, as the finest fortifications are
done in <i>Flanders</i>, with sods,——and as your Honour knows
they should be,—and I would make the walls and parapets with
sods too.—The best engineers call them gazons, <i>Trim</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Whether they are gazons or sods,
is not much matter, replied <i>Trim</i>; your Honour knows they are
ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stone.——I
know they are, <i>Trim</i> in some respects,——quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, nodding his head;—for a cannon-ball enters
into the gazon right onwards, without bringing any rubbish down
with it, which might fill the fossé, (as was the case at
<i>St. Nicolas</i>’s gate) and facilitate the passage over
it.</p>

<p>Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal
<i>Trim</i>, better than any officer in his Majesty’s
service;——but would your Honour please to let the
bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country,
I would work under your Honour’s directions like a horse, and
make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all
their batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it
should be worth all the world’s riding twenty miles to go and
see it.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> blushed as red as scarlet as <i>Trim</i>
went on;—but it was not a blush of guilt,—of
modesty,—or of anger,—it was a blush of joy;—he
was fired with Corporal <i>Trim</i>’s project and
description.—<i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, thou
hast said enough.—We might begin the campaign, continued
<i>Trim</i>, on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take
the field, and demolish them town by town as fast
as—<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, say no more. Your
Honour, continued <i>Trim</i>, might sit in your arm-chair
(pointing to it) this fine weather, giving me your orders, and I
would——Say no more, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——Besides, your Honour would get not only
pleasure and good pastime—but good air, and good exercise,
and good health,—and your Honour’s wound would be well
in a month. Thou hast said enough, <i>Trim</i>,—quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i> (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)——I like thy project
mightily.—And if your Honour pleases, I’ll this moment
go and buy a pioneer’s spade to take down with us, and
I’ll bespeak a shovel and a pick-axe, and a couple
of——Say no more, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome with
rapture,—and thrusting a guinea into <i>Trim</i>’s
hand,—<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, say no
more;—but go down, <i>Trim</i>, this moment, my lad, and
bring up my supper this instant.</p>

<p><i>Trim</i> ran down and brought up his master’s
supper,—to no purpose:—<i>Trim</i>’s plan of
operation ran so in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head, he could not
taste it.—<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, get me to
bed.—’Twas all one.—Corporal <i>Trim</i>’s
description had fired his imagination,—my uncle <i>Toby</i>
could not shut his eyes.—The more he considered it, the more
bewitching the scene appeared to him;—so that, two full hours
before day-light, he had come to a final determination and had
concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal <i>Trim</i>’s
decampment.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> had a little neat country-house of his own,
in the village where my father’s estate lay at <i>Shandy</i>,
which had been left him by an old uncle, with a small estate of
about one hundred pounds a-year. Behind this house, and contiguous
to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre, and at the
bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge, was
a bowling-green, containing just about as much ground as Corporal
<i>Trim</i> wished for;—so that as <i>Trim</i> uttered the
words, “A rood and a half of ground to do what they would
with,”—this identical bowling-green instantly presented
itself, and became curiously painted all at once, upon the retina
of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s fancy;—which was the physical
cause of making him change colour, or at least of heightening his
blush, to that immoderate degree I spoke of.</p>

<p>Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat
and expectation, than my uncle <i>Toby</i> did, to enjoy this
self-same thing in private;—I say in private;—for it was sheltered from the house, as
I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three
sides, from mortal sight, by rough holly and thick-set flowering
shrubs:—so that the idea of not being seen, did not a little
contribute to the idea of pleasure pre-conceived in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s mind.—Vain thought! however thick it was
planted about,——or private soever it might
seem,—to think, dear uncle <i>Toby</i>, of enjoying a thing
which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,—and not have
it known!</p>

<p>How my uncle <i>Toby</i> and Corporal <i>Trim</i> managed this
matter,—with the history of their campaigns, which were no
way barren of events,——may make no uninteresting
under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this drama.—At
present the scene must drop,—and change for the parlour
fire-side.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXI</small>
</h3>

<p>——W<small>HAT</small> can they be doing?
brother, said my father.—I think, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—taking, as I told you,
his pipe from his mouth, and striking the ashes out of it as he
began his sentence;——I think, replied he,—it
would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.</p>

<p>Pray, what’s all that racket over our heads,
<i>Obadiah?</i>——quoth my father;——my
brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak.</p>

<p>Sir, answered <i>Obadiah</i>, making a bow towards his left
shoulder,—my Mistress is taken very badly.—And
where’s <i>Susannah</i> running down the garden there, as if
they were going to ravish her?——Sir, she is running the
shortest cut into the town, replied <i>Obadiah</i>, to fetch the
old midwife.—Then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you
go directly for Dr. <i>Slop</i>, the man-midwife, with all our
services,——and let him know your mistress is fallen
into labour——and that I desire he will return with you
with all speed.</p>

<p>It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, as <i>Obadiah</i> shut the door,——as there
is so expert an operator as Dr. <i>Slop</i> so near,—that my
wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humour of
hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one misfortune
already, to the ignorance of an old woman;——and not
only the life of my child, brother,——but her own life,
and with it the lives of all the children I might, peradventure,
have begot out of her hereafter.</p>

<p>Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, my sister does it
to save the expence:—A pudding’s end,—replied my
father,——the Doctor must be paid the same for inaction
as action,—if not better,—to keep him in temper.</p>

<p>——Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in the simplicity of his
heart,—but M<small>ODESTY</small>.—My sister, I dare
say, added he, does not care to let a man come so near her ****. I
will not say whether my uncle <i>Toby</i> had completed the
sentence or not;—’tis for his advantage to suppose he
had,——as, I think, he could have added no O<small>NE</small> W<small>ORD</small>
which would have improved it.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had not fully arrived
at the period’s end—then the world stands indebted to
the sudden snapping of my father’s tobacco-pipe for one of
the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory, which
Rhetoricians stile the <i>Aposiopesis.</i>——Just
Heaven! how does the <i>Poco piu</i> and the <i>Poco meno</i> of
the <i>Italian</i> artists;—the insensible <small>MORE OR
LESS</small>, determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence,
as well as in the statue! How do the slight touches of the chisel,
the pencil, the pen, the fiddle-stick, <i>et
cætera</i>,—give the true swell, which gives the true
pleasure!—O my countrymen:—be nice; be cautious of your
language; and never, O! never let it be forgotten upon what small
particles your eloquence and your fame depend.</p>

<p>
——“My sister, mayhap,” quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
“does not choose to let a man come so near her ****” Make this
dash,—’tis an Aposiopesis,—Take the dash away, and write
<i>Backside</i>,—’tis Bawdy.—Scratch Backside out, and put
<i>Cover’d way</i> in, ’tis a Metaphor;—and, I dare say, as
fortification ran so much in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head, that if he had
been left to have added one word to the sentence,——that word was
it.
</p>

<p>But whether that was the case or not the case;—or whether
the snapping of my father’s tobacco-pipe, so critically,
happened through accident or anger, will be seen in due time.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HO</small>’ my father was a good
natural philosopher,—yet he was something of a moral
philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe
snapp’d short in the middle,—he had nothing to do, as
such, but to have taken hold of the two pieces, and thrown them
gently upon the back of the fire.——He did no such
thing;——he threw them with all the violence in the
world;—and, to give the action still more emphasis,—he
started upon both his legs to do it.</p>

<p>This looked something like heat;—and the manner of his
reply to what my uncle <i>Toby</i> was saying, proved it was
so.</p>

<p>—“Not choose,” quoth my father,
(repeating my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s words) “to let
a man come so near her!”——By Heaven,
brother <i>Toby!</i> you would try the patience of
<i>Job</i>;—and I think I have the plagues of one already
without
it.——Why?——Where?——Wherein?——Wherefore?——Upon
what account? replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>: in the utmost
astonishment.—To think, said my father, of a man living to
your age, brother, and knowing so little about
women!——I know nothing at all about them,—replied
my uncle <i>Toby</i>: And I think, continued he, that the shock I
received the year after the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>, in my
affair with widow <i>Wadman</i>;—which shock you know I
should not have received, but from my total ignorance of the
sex,—has given me just cause to say, That I neither know nor do pretend to know any thing
about ’em or their concerns either.—Methinks, brother,
replied my father, you might, at least, know so much as the right
end of a woman from the wrong.</p>

<p>It is said in <i>Aristotle’s Master Piece</i>,
“That when a man doth think of any thing which is
past,—he looketh down upon the ground;——but that
when he thinketh of something that is to come, he looketh up
towards the heavens.”</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, I suppose, thought of neither, for he
look’d horizontally.—Right end! quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, muttering the two words low to himself, and fixing his
two eyes insensibly as he muttered them, upon a small crevice,
formed by a bad joint in the chimney-piece——Right end
of a woman!——I declare, quoth my uncle, I know no more
which it is than the man in the moon;——and if I was to
think, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i> (keeping his eyes still fixed
upon the bad joint) this month together, I am sure I should not be able to find it out.</p>

<p>Then, brother <i>Toby</i>, replied my father, I will tell
you.</p>

<p>Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh
pipe)—every thing in this world, my dear brother <i>Toby</i>,
has two handles.——Not always, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——At least, replied my father, every one
has two hands,——which comes to the same
thing.——Now, if a man was to sit down coolly, and
consider within himself the make, the shape, the construction,
come-at-ability, and convenience of all the parts which constitute
the whole of that animal, called Woman, and compare them
analogically—I never understood rightly the meaning of that
word,—quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—</p>

<p>A<small>NALOGY</small>, replied my father, is the certain
relation and agreement which different——Here a devil of
a rap at the door snapped my father’s definition (like his
tobacco-pipe) in two,—and, at the same time, crushed the head
of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was
engendered in the womb of speculation;—it was some months
before my father could get an opportunity to be safely delivered of
it:—And, at this hour, it is a thing full as problematical as
the subject of the dissertation itself,—(considering the
confusion and distresses of our domestick misadventures, which are
now coming thick one upon the back of another) whether I shall be
able to find a place for it in the third volume or not.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is about an hour and a
half’s tolerable good reading since my uncle <i>Toby</i> rung
the bell, when <i>Obadiah</i> was ordered to saddle a horse, and go
for Dr. <i>Slop</i>, the man-midwife;—so that no one can say,
with reason, that I have not allowed <i>Obadiah</i> time enough,
poetically speaking, and considering the emergency too, both to go
and come;——though, morally and truly speaking, the
man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.</p>

<p>If the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all
to take a pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the
ringing of the bell, and the rap at the door;—and, after
finding it to be no more than two minutes, thirteen seconds, and
three-fifths,—should take upon him to insult over me for such
a breach in the unity, or rather probability of time;—I would
remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its simple modes, is
got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas——and is the true scholastic
pendulum,——and by which, as a scholar, I will be tried
in this matter,—abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of
all other pendulums whatever.</p>

<p>I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor
eight miles from <i>Shandy-Hall</i> to Dr. <i>Slop</i>, the
man-midwife’s house:—and that whilst <i>Obadiah</i> has
been going those said miles and back, I have brought my uncle
<i>Toby</i> from <i>Namur</i>, quite across all <i>Flanders</i>, into
<i>England</i>:—That I have had him ill upon my hands near
four years;—and have since travelled him and Corporal
<i>Trim</i> in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near two hundred
miles down into <i>Yorkshire.</i>—all which put together,
must have prepared the reader’s imagination for the entrance
of Dr. <i>Slop</i> upon the stage,—as much, at least (I hope)
as a dance, a song, or a concerto between the acts.</p>

<p>If my hypercritick is intractable, alledging, that two minutes
and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen
seconds,—when I have said all I can about them; and that this
plea, though it might save me dramatically, will damn me
biographically, rendering my book from this very moment, a
professed R<small>OMANCE</small>, which, before, was a book
apocryphal:——If I am thus pressed—I then put an
end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at
once,——by acquainting him, that <i>Obadiah</i> had not
got above threescore yards from the stable-yard, before he met
with Dr. <i>Slop</i>;—and indeed he gave a dirty
proof that he had met with him, and was within an ace of giving a
tragical one too.</p>

<p>Imagine to yourself;—but this had better begin a new
chapter.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>MAGINE</small> to yourself a little squat,
uncourtly figure of a Doctor <i>Slop</i>, of about four feet and a
half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a
sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant
in the horse-guards.</p>

<p>Such were the out-lines of Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s figure,
which—if you have read <i>Hogarth</i>’s analysis of
beauty, and if you have not, I wish you would;——you
must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to the
mind by three strokes as three hundred.</p>

<p>Imagine such a one,—for such, I say, were the outlines of
Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot,
waddling thro’ the dirt upon the vertebræ of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty
colour——but of
strength,——alack!——scarce able to have made
an amble of it, under such a fardel, had the roads been in an
ambling condition.——They were not.——Imagine
to yourself, <i>Obadiah</i> mounted upon a strong monster of a
coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable
speed the adverse way.</p>

<p>Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.</p>

<p>Had Dr. <i>Slop</i> beheld <i>Obadiah</i> a mile off, posting in
a narrow lane directly towards him, at that monstrous
rate,—splashing and plunging like a devil thro’ thick
and thin, as he approached, would not such a phænomenon, with
such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it, round its
axis,—have been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr.
<i>Slop</i> in his situation, than the <i>worst</i> of
<i>Whiston</i>’s comets?—To say nothing of the
N<small>UCLEUS</small>; that is, of <i>Obadiah</i> and the
coach-horse.—In my idea, the vortex alone of ’em was
enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the
doctor’s pony, quite away with it. What then do you think
must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr. <i>Slop</i> have been, when
you read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing
thus warily along towards <i>Shandy-Hall</i>, and had approached to
within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn,
made by an acute angle of the garden-wall,—and in the
dirtiest part of a dirty lane,—when <i>Obadiah</i> and his
coach-horse turned the corner, rapid,
furious,—pop,—full upon him!—Nothing, I think, in
nature, can be supposed more terrible than such a
rencounter,—so imprompt! so ill prepared to stand the shock
of it as Dr. <i>Slop</i> was.</p>

<p>What could Dr. <i>Slop</i> do?——he crossed himself +—Pugh!—but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist.—No
matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel.—He had
so;—nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at
all; for in crossing himself he let go his whip,——and
in attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle’s skirt, as it
slipped, he lost his stirrup,——in losing which he lost
his seat;——and in the multitude of all these losses
(which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in
crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind. So that
without waiting for <i>Obadiah</i>’s onset, he left his pony
to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile
and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence
from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been) with
the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the
mire.</p>

<p><i>Obadiah</i> pull’d off his cap twice to Dr.
<i>Slop</i>;—once as he was falling,—and then again
when he saw him seated.——Ill-timed
complaisance;—had not the fellow better have stopped his
horse, and got off and help’d him?—Sir, he did all that
his situation would allow;—but the M<small>OMENTUM</small> of
the coach-horse was so great, that <i>Obadiah</i> could not do it
all at once; he rode in a circle three times round Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
before he could fully accomplish it any how;—and at the last, when
he did stop his beast, ’twas done with such an explosion of
mud, that <i>Obadiah</i> had better have been a league off. In
short, never was a Dr. <i>Slop</i> so beluted, and so
transubstantiated, since that affair came into fashion.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> Dr. <i>Slop</i> entered the back
parlour, where my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> were discoursing
upon the nature of women,——it was hard to determine
whether Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s figure, or Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s
presence, occasioned more surprize to them; for as the accident
happened so near the house, as not to make it worth while for
<i>Obadiah</i> to remount him,——<i>Obadiah</i> had led
him in as he was, <i>unwiped, unappointed, unannealed</i>, with all
his stains and blotches on him.—He stood like
<i>Hamlet</i>’s ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full
minute and a half at the parlour-door (<i>Obadiah</i> still holding
his hand) with all the majesty of mud. His hinder parts, upon which he had
received his fall, totally besmeared,——and in every
other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with
<i>Obadiah</i>’s explosion, that you would have sworn
(without mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken
effect.</p>

<p>
Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle <i>Toby</i> to have triumphed over my
father in his turn;—for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. <i>Slop</i> in that
pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s opinion, “That mayhap his sister might not care to
let such a Dr. <i>Slop</i> come so near her ****” But it was the
<i>Argumentum ad hominem</i>; and if my uncle <i>Toby</i> was not very expert
at it, you may think, he might not care to use it.——No; the reason
was,—’twas not his nature to insult.
</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s presence at that time, was no less
problematical than the mode of it; tho’ it is certain, one
moment’s reflexion in my father might have solved it; for he
had apprized Dr. <i>Slop</i> but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning;
and as the doctor had heard nothing since, ’twas natural and
very political too in him, to have taken a ride to
<i>Shandy-Hall</i>, as he did, merely to see how matters went
on.</p>

<p>But my father’s mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in
the investigation; running, like the hypercritick’s,
altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the
door,—measuring their distance, and keeping his mind so
intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing
else,——common-place infirmity of the greatest
mathematicians! working with might and main at the demonstration,
and so wasting all their strength upon it, that they have none left
in them to draw the corollary, to do good with.</p>

<p>The ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck
likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—but it excited a very different train of
thoughts;—the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly
brought <i>Stevinus</i>, the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s mind. What business <i>Stevinus</i> had in this
affair,—is the greatest problem of all:——It shall
be solved,—but not in the next chapter.</p>

<p>W<small>RITING</small>, when properly managed (as
you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for
conversation. As no one, who knows what he is about in good
company, would venture to talk all;——so no author, who
understands the just boundaries of decorum and good-breeding, would
presume to think all: The truest respect which you can pay to the
reader’s understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and
leave him something to imagine, in his turn, as well as
yourself.</p>

<p>For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this
kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as
busy as my own.</p>

<p>’Tis his turn now;—I have given an ample description of Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s sad
overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;—his
imagination must now go on with it for a while.</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine then, that Dr. <i>Slop</i> has told his
tale—and in what words, and with what aggravations, his fancy
chooses;—Let him suppose, that <i>Obadiah</i> has told his
tale also, and with such rueful looks of affected concern, as he
thinks best will contrast the two figures as they stand by each
other.—Let him imagine, that my father has stepped up stairs
to see my mother.—And, to conclude this work of
imagination,—let him imagine the doctor washed,—rubbed
down, and condoled,—felicitated,—got into a pair of
<i>Obadiah</i>’s pumps, stepping forwards towards the door,
upon the very point of entering upon action.</p>

<p>Truce!—truce, good Dr. <i>Slop!</i>—stay thy
obstetrick hand;——return it safe into thy bosom to keep
it warm;——little dost thou know what
obstacles,——little dost thou think what hidden
causes, retard its operation!——Hast thou, Dr.
<i>Slop</i>,—hast thou been entrusted with the secret
articles of the solemn treaty which has brought thee into this
place?—Art thou aware that at this instant, a daughter of
<i>Lucina</i> is put obstetrically over thy head?
Alas!—’tis too true.—Besides, great son of
<i>Pilumnus!</i> what canst thou do? Thou hast come forth
unarm’d;—thou hast left thy
<i>tire-téte</i>,—thy new-invented
<i>forceps</i>,—thy <i>crotchet</i>,—thy <i>squirt</i>,
and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance, behind
thee,—By Heaven! at this moment they are hanging up in a
green bays bag, betwixt thy two pistols, at the bed’s
head!—Ring;—call;—send <i>Obadiah</i> back upon
the coach-horse to bring them with all speed.</p>

<p>——Make great haste, <i>Obadiah</i>, quoth my father,
and I’ll give thee a crown! and quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
I’ll give him another.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>Y<small>OUR</small> sudden and unexpected arrival,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
(all three of them sitting down to the fire together, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> began to speak)—instantly brought the great
<i>Stevinus</i> into my head, who, you must know, is a favourite
author with me.—Then, added my father, making use of the
argument <i>Ad Crumenam</i>,—I will lay twenty guineas to a
single crown-piece (which will serve to give away to <i>Obadiah</i>
when he gets back) that this same <i>Stevinus</i> was some engineer
or other—or has wrote something or other, either directly or
indirectly, upon the science of fortification.</p>

<p>He has so,—replied my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—I knew it,
said my father, though, for the soul of me, I cannot see what kind
of connection there can be betwixt Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s sudden
coming, and a discourse upon fortification;—yet I
fear’d it.—Talk of what we will,
brother,——or let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for
the subject,—you are sure to bring it in. I would not,
brother <i>Toby</i>, continued my father,——I declare I
would not have my head so full of curtins and
horn-works.—That I dare say you would not, quoth Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, interrupting him, and laughing most immoderately at
his pun.</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i> the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or
the insinuation of a pun, more cordially than my father;—he
would grow testy upon it at any time;—but to be broke in upon
by one, in a serious discourse, was as bad, he would say, as a
fillip upon the nose;——he saw no difference.</p>

<p>Sir, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to Dr.
<i>Slop</i>,—the curtins my brother <i>Shandy</i> mentions
here, have nothing to do with beadsteads;—tho’, I know
<i>Du Cange</i> says, “That bed-curtains, in all
probability, have taken their name from them;”—nor have
the horn-works he speaks of, any thing in the world to do with the
horn-works of cuckoldom: But the <i>Curtin</i>, Sir, is the
word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or rampart
which lies between the two bastions and joins them—Besiegers
seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin,
for this reason, because they are so well <i>flanked.</i>
(&nbsp;’Tis the case of other curtains, quoth Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, laughing.) However, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to
make them sure, we generally choose to place ravelins before them,
taking care only to extend them beyond the fossé or
ditch:——The common men, who know very little of
fortification, confound the ravelin and the half-moon
together,—tho’ they are very different
things;—not in their figure or construction, for we make them
exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of two faces,
making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in form
of a crescent;——Where then lies the difference? (quoth
my father, a little testily.)—In their situations, answered
my uncle <i>Toby:</i>—For when a ravelin, brother, stands
before the curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a ravelin
stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a
ravelin;—it is a half-moon;—a half-moon likewise is a
half-moon, and no more, so long as it stands before its
bastion;——but was it to change place, and get before
the curtin,—’twould be no longer a half-moon; a
half-moon, in that case, is not a half-moon;—’tis no
more than a ravelin.——I think, quoth my father, that
the noble science of defence has its weak sides——as
well as others.</p>

<p>—As for the horn-work (high! ho! sigh’d my father)
which, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, my brother was speaking of,
they are a very considerable part of an outwork;——they
are called by the <i>French</i> engineers, <i>Ouvrage à
corne</i>, and we generally make them to cover such places as we
suspect to be weaker than the rest;—’tis formed by two
epaulments or demi-bastions—they are very pretty,—and
if you will take a walk, I’ll engage to shew you one well
worth your trouble.—I own, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
when we crown them,—they are much stronger, but
then they are very expensive, and take up a great deal of ground,
so that, in my opinion, they are most of use to cover or defend the
head of a camp; otherwise the double tenaille—By the mother
who bore us!——brother <i>Toby</i>, quoth my father, not
able to hold out any longer,——you would provoke a
saint;——here have you got us, I know not how, not only
souse into the middle of the old subject again:—But so full
is your head of these confounded works, that though my wife is this
moment in the pains of labour, and you hear her cry out, yet
nothing will serve you but to carry off the
man-midwife.——<i>Accoucheur</i>,—if you please,
quoth Dr. <i>Slop.</i>—With all my heart, replied my father,
I don’t care what they call you,—but I wish the whole
science of fortification, with all its inventors, at the
devil;—it has been the death of thousands,—and it will
be mine in the end.—I would not, I would not, brother
<i>Toby</i>, have my brains so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes, ravelins, half-moons, and such
trumpery, to be proprietor of <i>Namur</i>, and of all the towns in
<i>Flanders</i> with it.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> was a man patient of injuries;—not
from want of courage,—I have told you in a former chapter,
“that he was a man of courage:”—And will
add here, that where just occasions presented, or called it
forth,—I know no man under whose arm I would have sooner
taken shelter;——nor did this arise from any
insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;—for he
felt this insult of my father’s as feelingly as a man could
do;—but he was of a peaceful, placid nature,—no jarring
element in it,—all was mixed up so kindly within him; my
uncle <i>Toby</i> had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly.</p>

<p>—Go—says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one
which had buzzed about his nose, and tormented him cruelly all
dinner-time,—and which after infinite attempts, he had caught
at last, as it flew by him;—I’ll not hurt thee,
says my uncle <i>Toby</i>, rising from his chair, and going across
the room, with the fly in his hand,—I’ll not hurt a
hair of thy head:—Go, says he, lifting up the sash, and
opening his hand as he spoke, to let it escape;—go, poor
devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee?——This
world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me.</p>

<p>I was but ten years old when this happened: but whether it was,
that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age
of pity, which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of
most pleasurable sensation;—or how far the manner and
expression of it might go towards it;—or in what degree, or
by what secret magick,—a tone of voice and harmony of
movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart, I
know not;—this I know, that the lesson of universal good-will
then taught and imprinted by my uncle <i>Toby</i>, has never since
been worn out of my mind: And tho’ I would not depreciate what the study of the <i>Literæ
humaniores</i>, at the university, have done for me in that
respect, or discredit the other helps of an expensive education
bestowed upon me, both at home and abroad since;—yet I often
think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental
impression.</p>

<p>This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole
volume upon the subject.</p>

<p>I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s picture, by the instrument with which I drew
the other parts of it,—that taking in no more than the mere
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSICAL</small> likeness:—this
is a part of his moral character. My father, in this patient
endurance of wrongs, which I mention, was very different, as the
reader must long ago have noted; he had a much more acute and quick
sensibility of nature, attended with a little soreness of temper;
tho’ this never transported him to any thing which looked
like malignancy:—yet in the little rubs and vexations of
life, ’twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of
peevishness:——He was, however, frank and generous in
his nature;——at all times open to conviction; and in
the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards others, but
particularly towards my uncle <i>Toby</i>, whom he truly
loved:——he would feel more pain, ten times told (except
in the affair of my aunt <i>Dinah</i>, or where an hypothesis was
concerned) than what he ever gave.</p>

<p>The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them,
reflected light upon each other, and appeared with great advantage
in this affair which arose about <i>Stevinus.</i></p>

<p>I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>,—that a man’s
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> is as tender a part as he
has about him; and that these unprovoked strokes at my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s could not be unfelt by
him.——No:——as I said above, my uncle
<i>Toby</i> did feel them, and very sensibly too.</p>

<p>Pray, Sir, what said he?—How did he behave?—O,
Sir!—it was great: For as soon as my father had done insulting his
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small>,——he turned
his head without the least emotion, from Dr. <i>Slop</i>, to whom
he was addressing his discourse, and looking up into my
father’s face, with a countenance spread over with so much
good-nature;——so placid;——so
fraternal;——so inexpressibly tender towards
him:—it penetrated my father to his heart: He rose up hastily
from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s hands as he spoke:—Brother <i>Toby</i>,
said he:—I beg thy pardon;——forgive, I pray thee,
this rash humour which my mother gave me.——My dear,
dear brother, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, rising up by my
father’s help, say no more about it;—you are heartily
welcome, had it been ten times as much, brother. But ’tis
ungenerous, replied my father, to hurt any man;——a
brother worse;——but to hurt a brother of such gentle
manners,—so unprovoking,—and so
unresenting;——’tis base:——By Heaven,
’tis cowardly.—You are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——had it been
fifty times as much.——Besides, what have I to do, my
dear <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, either with your amusements or
your pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it is not) to
increase their measure?</p>

<p>——Brother <i>Shandy</i>, answered my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, looking wistfully in his face,——you are
much mistaken in this point:—for you do increase my pleasure
very much, in begetting children for the <i>Shandy</i> family at
your time of life.—But, by that, Sir, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
Mr. <i>Shandy</i> increases his own.—Not a jot, quoth my
father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> brother does it, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, out of <i>principle.</i>——In a family way,
I suppose, quoth Dr. <i>Slop.</i>——Pshaw!—said my
father,—’tis not worth talking of.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>T</small> the end of the last chapter, my
father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> were left both standing, like
<i>Brutus</i> and <i>Cassius</i>, at the close of the scene, making
up their accounts.</p>

<p>As my father spoke the three last words,——he sat
down;—my uncle <i>Toby</i> exactly followed his example,
only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order
Corporal <i>Trim</i>, who was in waiting, to step home for
<i>Stevinus</i>:—my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s house being no
farther off than the opposite side of the way.</p>

<p>Some men would have dropped the subject of
<i>Stevinus</i>;—but my uncle <i>Toby</i> had no resentment
in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father
that he had none.</p>

<p>Your sudden appearance, Dr. <i>Slop</i>, quoth my uncle,
resuming the discourse, instantly brought <i>Stevinus</i> into my
head. (My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more
wagers upon <i>Stevinus</i>’s head.)——Because,
continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, the celebrated sailing chariot,
which belonged to Prince <i>Maurice</i>, and was of such wonderful
contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty
<i>German</i> miles, in I don’t know how few
minutes,——was invented by <i>Stevinus</i>, that great
mathematician and engineer.</p>

<p>You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr.
<i>Slop</i> (as the fellow is lame) of going for
<i>Stevinus</i>’s account of it, because in my return from
<i>Leyden</i> thro’ the <i>Hague</i>, I walked as far as
<i>Schevling</i>, which is two long miles, on purpose to take a
view of it.</p>

<p>That’s nothing, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to what the
learned <i>Peireskius</i> did, who walked a matter of five hundred
miles, reckoning from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Schevling</i>, and from
<i>Schevling</i> to <i>Paris</i> back again, in order to see
it,—and nothing else.</p>

<p>Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.</p>

<p>The more fool <i>Peireskius</i>, replied Dr. <i>Slop.</i> But
mark, ’twas out of no contempt of <i>Peireskius</i> at
all;——but that <i>Peireskius</i>’s indefatigable labour in
trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced the
exploit of Dr. <i>Slop</i>, in that affair, to nothing:—the
more fool <i>Peireskius</i>, said he again.—Why
so?—replied my father, taking his brother’s part, not
only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had
given him, which sat still upon my father’s
mind;——but partly, that my father began really to
interest himself in the discourse.——Why
so?——said he. Why is <i>Peireskius</i>, or any man
else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of
sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot
in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very
mechanical head; and tho’ I cannot guess upon what principles
of philosophy he has atchieved it;—yet certainly his machine
has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it
could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions.</p>

<p>It answered, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as well, if not better; for, as <i>Peireskius</i>
elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion,
<i>Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus</i>; which, unless I have
forgot my Latin, is, <i>that it was as swift as the wind
itself.</i></p>

<p>But pray, Dr. <i>Slop</i>, quoth my father, interrupting my
uncle (tho’ not without begging pardon for it at the same
time) upon what principles was this self-same chariot set
a-going?—Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr.
<i>Slop</i>:—And I have often wondered, continued he, evading
the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains
like this of ours,—(especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is
subject,—if the wind only served,—but would be
excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost
nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the
devil take ’em) both cost and eat a great deal.</p>

<p>For that very reason, replied my father,
“Because they cost nothing, and because they eat
nothing,”—the scheme is bad;—it is the
consumption of our products, as well as the manufactures of them,
which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade,—brings in
money, and supports the value of our lands;—and tho’, I
own, if I was a Prince, I would generously recompense the
scientifick head which brought forth such contrivances;—yet I
would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.</p>

<p>My father here had got into his element,—and was going on
as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> had before, upon his of fortification;—but to the
loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had
decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by my
father that day,——for as he opened his mouth to begin
the next sentence,</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XL</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> popped Corporal <i>Trim</i> with
<i>Stevinus</i>:—But ’twas too late,—all the
discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a
new channel.</p>

<p>—You may take the book home again, <i>Trim</i>, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, nodding to him.</p>

<p>But prithee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,—look
first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot
in it.</p>

<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i>, by being in the service, had learned to
obey,—and not to remonstrate,—so taking the book to a
side-table, and running over the leaves; An’ please your
Honour, said <i>Trim</i>, I can see no such thing;—however,
continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I’ll
make sure work of it, an’ please your Honour;—so taking
hold of the two covers of the book, one in each hand, and letting
the leaves fall down as he bent the covers back, he gave the book a good sound
shake.</p>

<p>There is something falling out, however, said <i>Trim</i>,
an’ please your Honour;—but it is not a chariot, or any
thing like one:—Prithee, Corporal, said my father, smiling,
what is it then?—I think, answered <i>Trim</i>, stooping to
take it up,——’tis more like a
sermon,——for it begins with a text of scripture, and
the chapter and verse;—and then goes on, not as a chariot,
but like a sermon directly.</p>

<p>The company smiled.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my
<i>Stevinus.</i></p>

<p>I think ’tis a sermon, replied <i>Trim</i>:—but if
it please your Honours, as it is a fair hand, I will read you a
page;—for <i>Trim</i>, you must know, loved to hear himself
read almost as well as talk.</p>

<p>I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into
things which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as
these;—and as we have nothing better to do, at least till <i>Obadiah</i> gets back, I
shall be obliged to you, brother, if Dr. <i>Slop</i> has no
objection to it, to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of
it,—if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing. An’
please your honour, quoth <i>Trim</i>, I officiated two whole
campaigns, in <i>Flanders</i>, as clerk to the chaplain of the
regiment.——He can read it, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
as well as I can.——<i>Trim</i>, I assure you, was the
best scholar in my company, and should have had the next halberd,
but for the poor fellow’s misfortune. Corporal <i>Trim</i>
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master;
then laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon
in his left hand, in order to have his right at liberty,—he
advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where he
could best see, and be best seen by his audience.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLI</small>
</h3>

<p>—I<small>F</small> you have any
objection,—said my father, addressing himself to Dr.
<i>Slop.</i> Not in the least, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>;—for
it does not appear on which side of the question it is
wrote,—it may be a composition of a divine of our church, as
well as yours,—so that we run equal
risques.——’Tis wrote upon neither side, quoth
<i>Trim</i>, for ’tis only upon <i>Conscience</i>, an’
please your Honours.</p>

<p><i>Trim</i>’s reason put his audience into good
humour,—all but Dr. <i>Slop</i>, who turning his head about
towards <i>Trim</i>, looked a little angry.</p>

<p>Begin, <i>Trim</i>,—and read distinctly, quoth my
father.—I will, an’ please your Honour, replied the
Corporal, making a bow, and bespeaking attention with a slight
movement of his right hand.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLII</small>
</h3>

<p>——B<small>UT</small> before the Corporal
begins, I must first give you a description of his
attitude;——otherwise he will naturally stand
represented, by your imagination, in an uneasy
posture,—stiff,—perpendicular,—dividing the
weight of his body equally upon both legs;——his eye fixed,
as if on duty;—his look determined,—clenching the
sermon in his left hand, like his firelock.——In a word,
you would be apt to paint <i>Trim</i>, as if he was standing in his
platoon ready for action,—His attitude was as unlike all this
as you can conceive.</p>

<p>He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards
just so far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the
plain of the horizon;—which sound orators, to whom I address
this, know very well to be the true persuasive angle of
incidence;—in any other angle you may talk and
preach;—’tis certain;—and it is done every
day;—but with what effect,—I leave the world to
judge!</p>

<p>The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to
a mathematical exactness,——does it not shew us, by the
way, how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other?</p>

<p>How the duce Corporal <i>Trim</i>, who knew not so much as an
acute angle from an obtuse one, came to hit it so
exactly;——or whether it was chance or nature, or good
sense or imitation, &amp;c. shall be commented upon in that part of
the cyclopædia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental
parts of the eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the
coffee-house, the bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under
consideration.</p>

<p>He stood,——for I repeat it, to take the picture of
him in at one view, with his body swayed, and somewhat bent
forwards,—his right leg from under him, sustaining
seven-eighths of his whole weight,——the foot of his
left leg, the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude,
advanced a little,—not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line
betwixt them;—his knee bent, but that not
violently,—but so as to fall within the limits of the line of
beauty;—and I add, of the line of science too;—for
consider, it had one eighth part of his body to bear up;—so
that in this case the position of the leg is
determined,—because the foot could be no farther advanced, or
the knee more bent, than what would allow him, mechanically
to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it, and to
carry it too.</p>

<p>=&gt; This I recommend to painters;—need I add,—to
orators!—I think not; for unless they practise
it,——they must fall upon their noses.</p>

<p>So much for Corporal <i>Trim</i>’s body and
legs.——He held the sermon loosely, not carelessly, in
his left hand, raised something above his stomach, and detached a
little from his breast;——his right arm falling
negligently by his side, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered
it,——but with the palm of it open and turned towards
his audience, ready to aid the sentiment in case it stood in
need.</p>

<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i>’s eyes and the muscles of his face
were in full harmony with the other parts of him;—he looked
frank,—unconstrained,—something assured,—but not
bordering upon assurance.</p>

<p>Let not the critic ask how Corporal <i>Trim</i> could come by
all this.——I’ve told him it should be explained;—but so he
stood before my father, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and Dr.
<i>Slop</i>,—so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and
with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole
figure,——a statuary might have modelled from
it;——nay, I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a
College,—or the <i>Hebrew</i> Professor himself, could have
much mended it.</p>

<p><i>Trim</i> made a bow, and read as follows:</p>

<p>
“T<small>RUST</small>!——Trust we have a
good conscience!”</p>

<p>[Certainly, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my father, interrupting him, you
give that sentence a very improper accent; for you curl up your
nose, man, and read it with such a sneering tone, as if the Parson
was going to abuse the Apostle.</p>

<p>He is, an’ please your Honour, replied <i>Trim.</i> Pugh!
said my father, smiling.</p>

<p>Sir, quoth Dr. <i>Slop, Trim</i> is certainly in the right; for
the writer (who I perceive is a Protestant) by the snappish manner
in which he takes up the apostle, is certainly going to abuse
him;—if this treatment of him has not done it already. But
from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so soon, Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, that the writer is of our church?—for aught I
can see yet,—he may be of any church.——Because,
answered Dr. <i>Slop</i>, if he was of ours,—he durst no more
take such a licence,—than a bear by his beard:—If, in
our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle,——a
saint,——or even the paring of a saint’s
nail,—he would have his eyes scratched out.—What, by
the saint? quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i> No, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
he would have an old house over his head. Pray is the Inquisition
an ancient building, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, or is it a
modern one?—I know nothing of architecture, replied Dr.
<i>Slop.</i>—An’ please your Honours, quoth <i>Trim</i>, the Inquisition is the
vilest——Prithee spare thy description, <i>Trim</i>, I
hate the very name of it, said my father.—No matter for that,
answered Dr. <i>Slop</i>,—it has its uses; for tho’
I’m no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case as this, he
would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he went
on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains.
God help him then, quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i> Amen, added
<i>Trim</i>; for Heaven above knows, I have a poor brother who has
been fourteen years a captive in it.—I never heard one word
of it before, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, hastily:—How came he
there, <i>Trim</i>?——O, Sir, the story will make your
heart bleed,—as it has made mine a thousand times;—but
it is too long to be told now;—your Honour shall hear it from
first to last some day when I am working beside you in our
fortifications;—but the short of the story is
this;—That my brother <i>Tom</i> went over a servant to
<i>Lisbon</i>,—and then married a Jew’s widow, who kept
a small shop, and sold sausages, which somehow or other, was the cause of
his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he
was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried
directly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued
<i>Trim</i>, fetching a sigh from the bottom of his
heart,—the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour; he was
as honest a soul, added <i>Trim</i>, (pulling out his handkerchief)
as ever blood warmed.——</p>

<p>—The tears trickled down <i>Trim</i>’s cheeks faster
than he could well wipe them away.—A dead silence in the room
ensued for some minutes.—Certain proof of pity!</p>

<p>Come <i>Trim</i>, quoth my father, after he saw the poor
fellow’s grief had got a little vent,—read
on,—and put this melancholy story out of thy head:—I
grieve that I interrupted thee; but prithee begin the sermon
again;—for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as
thou sayest, I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation
the apostle has given.</p>

<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i> wiped his face, and returned his
handkerchief into his pocket, and, making a bow as he did
it,—he began again.]</p>

<p class="center">
The S&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;M&nbsp;O&nbsp;N.<br>
<br>
H<small>EBREWS</small> xiii. 18.<br>
<br>
——<i>For we</i> trust <i>we have a good<br>
Conscience.—</i>
</p>

<p>“T<small>RUST</small>! trust we have a
good conscience! Surely if there is any thing in this life which a
man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he is capable of
arriving upon the most indisputable evidence, it must be this very
thing,—whether he has a good conscience or no.”</p>

<p>[I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. <i>Slop.</i>]</p>

<p>“If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a
stranger to the true state of this account:——he must be
privy to his own thoughts and desires;—he must remember his
past pursuits, and know “certainly the true springs and motives,
which, in general, have governed the actions of his
life.”</p>

<p>[I defy him, without an assistant, quoth Dr. <i>Slop.</i>]</p>

<p>“In other matters we may be deceived by false
appearances; and, as the wise man complains, <i>hardly do we guess
aright at the things that are upon the earth, and with labour do we
find the things that are before us.</i> But here the mind has all
the evidence and facts within herself;——is conscious of
the web she has wove;——knows its texture and fineness,
and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the
several designs which virtue or vice has planned before
her.”</p>

<p>[The language is good, and I declare <i>Trim</i> reads very
well, quoth my father.]</p>

<p>“Now,—as conscience is nothing else but the
knowledge which the mind has within herself of this; and the
judgment, either of approbation or censure, which it unavoidably
makes upon the successive actions of our lives; ’tis
plain you will say, from the very terms of the
proposition,—whenever this inward testimony goes against a
man, and he stands self-accused, that he must necessarily be a
guilty man.—And, on the contrary, when the report is
favourable on his side, and his heart condemns him not:—that
it is not a matter of trust, as the apostle intimates, but a matter
of certainty and fact, that the conscience is good, and that the
man must be good also.”</p>

<p>[Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose, quoth
Dr. <i>Slop</i>, and the Protestant divine is in the right. Sir,
have patience, replied my father, for I think it will presently
appear that St. <i>Paul</i> and the Protestant divine are both of
an opinion.—As nearly so, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, as east is
to west;—but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes
from the liberty of the press.</p>

<p>It is no more at the worst, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, than
the liberty of the pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is
printed, or ever likely to be.</p>

<p>Go on, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my father.]</p>

<p>“At first sight this may seem to be a true state of
the case: and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong
is so truly impressed upon the mind of man,—that did no such
thing ever happen, as that the conscience of a man, by long habits
of sin, might (as the scripture assures it may) insensibly become
hard;—and, like some tender parts of his body, by much stress
and continual hard usage, lose by degrees that nice sense and
perception with which God and nature endowed it:—Did this
never happen;—or was it certain that self-love could never
hang the least bias upon the judgment;—or that the little
interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our
upper regions, and encompass them about with clouds and thick
darkness:——Could no such thing as favour and affection
enter this sacred Court—Did W<small>IT</small> disdain “to take a bribe in it;—or was
ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable
enjoyment: Or, lastly, were we assured that I<small>NTEREST</small>
stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing—and
that Passion never got into the judgment-seat, and pronounced
sentence in the stead of Reason, which is supposed always to
preside and determine upon the case:—Was this truly so, as
the objection must suppose;—no doubt then the religious and
moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed
it:—and the guilt or innocence of every man’s life
could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the degrees
of his own approbation and censure.</p>

<p>“I own, in one case, whenever a man’s
conscience does accuse him (as it seldom errs on that side) that he
is guilty;—and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases,
we may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always sufficient
grounds for the accusation.</p>

<p>“But the converse of the proposition will not hold
true;—namely, that whenever there is guilt, the conscience
must accuse; and if it does not, that a man is therefore
innocent.——This is not fact——So that the
common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly
administering to himself,—that he thanks God his mind does
not misgive him; and that, consequently, he has a good conscience,
because he hath a quiet one,—is fallacious;—and as
current as the inference is, and as infallible as the rule appears
at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the truth
of this rule upon plain facts,——you see it liable to so
much error from a false application;——the principle
upon which it goes so often perverted;——the whole force
of it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast away, that it is painful
to produce the common examples from human life, which confirm the
account.</p>

<p>
“A man shall be vicious and utterly “debauched in his
principles;—exceptionable in his conduct to the world; shall live
shameless, in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can
justify,——a sin by which, contrary to all the workings of humanity,
he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt;—rob her of her
best dowry; and not only cover her own head with dishonour;—but involve a
whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake. Surely, you will think
conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life; he can have no rest night
and day from its reproaches.
</p>

<p>“Alas! Conscience had something else to do all this
time, than break in upon him; as <i>Elijah</i> reproached the god
<i>Baal</i>,——this domestic god <i>was either talking,
or pursuing, or was in a journey, or peradventure he slept and
could not be awoke.</i></p>

<p>“Perhaps H<small>E</small> was gone out in company
with H<small>ONOUR</small> to fight a duel: to pay off some debt at
play;——or “dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust;
Perhaps C<small>ONSCIENCE</small> all this time was engaged at
home, talking aloud against petty larceny, and executing vengeance
upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured
him against all temptation of committing; so that he lives as
merrily;”——[If he was of our church, tho’,
quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, he could not]—“sleeps as soundly
in his bed;—and at last meets death
unconcernedly;—perhaps much more so, than a much better
man.”</p>

<p>[All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, turning
to my father,—the case could not happen in our
church.—It happens in ours, however, replied my father, but
too often.——I own, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, (struck a
little with my father’s frank acknowledgment)—that a
man in the <i>Romish</i> church may live as badly;—but then
he cannot easily die so.——’Tis little matter,
replied my father, with an air of indifference,—how a
rascal dies.—I mean, answered Dr. <i>Slop</i>, he
would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.—Pray how
many have you in all, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——for I
always forget?——Seven, answered Dr.
<i>Slop.</i>——Humph!—said my uncle <i>Toby</i>;
tho’ not accented as a note of acquiescence,—but as an
interjection of that particular species of surprize, when a man in
looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing than he
expected.——Humph! replied my uncle <i>Toby.</i> Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, who had an ear, understood my uncle <i>Toby</i> as
well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven
sacraments.——Humph! replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, (stating
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s argument over again to
him)——Why, Sir, are there not seven cardinal
virtues?——Seven mortal sins?——Seven golden
candlesticks?——Seven heavens?—’Tis more
than I know, replied my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——Are there
not seven wonders of the world?——Seven days of the
creation?——Seven planets?——Seven
plagues?——That there are, quoth my father with a most affected gravity. But prithee,
continued he, go on with the rest of thy characters,
<i>Trim.</i>]</p>

<p>“Another is sordid, unmerciful,” (here
<i>Trim</i> waved his right hand) “a strait-hearted,
selfish wretch, incapable either of private friendship or public
spirit. Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their
distress, and sees all the miseries incident to human life without
a sigh or a prayer.” [An’ please your honours, cried
<i>Trim</i>, I think this a viler man than the other.]</p>

<p>“Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such
occasions?——No; thank God there is no occasion, <i>I
pay every man his own;—I have no fornication to answer to my
conscience;—no faithless vows or promises to make up;—I
have debauched no man’s wife or child; thank God, I am not as
other men, adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who
stands before me.</i></p>

<p>“A third is crafty and designing in his nature. View
his whole life;—’tis nothing but a cunning
contexture “of dark arts and unequitable
subterfuges, basely to defeat the true intent of all
laws,——plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our
several properties.——You will see such a one working
out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities
of the poor and needy man;—shall raise a fortune upon the
inexperience of a youth, or the unsuspecting temper of his friend,
who would have trusted him with his life.</p>

<p>“When old age comes on, and repentance calls him to
look back upon this black account, and state it over again with his
conscience—C<small>ONSCIENCE</small> looks into the
S<small>TATUTES AT</small> L<small>ARGE</small>;—finds no
express law broken by what he has done;—perceives no penalty
or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurred;—sees no scourge
waving over his head, or prison opening his gates upon
him:—What is there to affright his
conscience?—Conscience has got safely entrenched behind the
Letter of the Law; sits “there invulnerable, fortified with
Cases and
Reports so strongly on all sides;—that it is
not preaching can dispossess it of its hold.”</p>

<p>[Here Corporal <i>Trim</i> and my uncle <i>Toby</i> exchanged
looks with each other.—Aye, Aye, <i>Trim!</i> quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, shaking his head,——these are but sorry
fortifications, <i>Trim.</i>———O! very poor work,
answered <i>Trim</i>, to what your Honour and I make of
it.——The character of this last man, said Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, interrupting <i>Trim</i>, is more detestable than all
the rest; and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging
Lawyer amongst you:—Amongst us, a man’s conscience
could not possibly continue so long
<i>blinded</i>,——three times in a year, at least, he
must go to confession. Will that restore it to sight? quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>,——Go on, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my
father, or <i>Obadiah</i> will have got back before thou has got to
the end of thy sermon.——’Tis a very short one,
replied <i>Trim.</i>—I wish it was longer, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for I like it
hugely.—<i>Trim</i> went on.]</p>

<p>“A fourth man shall want even this
refuge;—shall break through all their ceremony of slow
chicane;—scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and
cautious trains to bring about his purpose:——See the
bare-faced villain, how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs,
murders!—Horrid!—But indeed much better was not to be
expected, in the present case—the poor man was in the
dark!——his priest had got the keeping of his
conscience;——and all he would let him know of it, was,
That he must believe in the Pope;—go to Mass;—cross
himself;—tell his beads;—be a good Catholic, and that
this, in all conscience, was enough to carry him to heaven.
What;—if he perjures?—Why;—he had a mental
reservation in it.—But if he is so wicked and abandoned a
wretch as you represent him;—if he robs,—if he stabs,
will not conscience, “on every such act, receive a wound
itself?—Aye,—but the man has carried it to
confession;—the wound digests there, and will do well enough,
and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution. O Popery!
what hast thou to answer for!——when not content with
the too many natural and fatal ways, thro’ which the heart of
man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all
things;—thou hast wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit
before the face of this unwary traveller, too apt, God knows, to go
astray of himself, and confidently speak peace to himself, when
there is no peace.</p>

<p>“Of this the common instances which I have drawn out
of life, are too notorious to require much evidence. If any man
doubts the reality of them, or thinks it impossible for a man to be
such a bubble to himself,—I must refer him a moment to his
own reflections, and will then venture to trust my appeal with his
own heart.</p>

<p>“Let him consider in how different a degree of
detestation, numbers of wicked actions stand <i>there</i>,
tho’ equally bad and vicious in their own natures;—he
will soon find, that such of them as strong inclination and custom
have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted
with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can
give them;—and that the others, to which he feels no
propensity, appear, at once, naked and deformed, surrounded with
all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour.</p>

<p>“When <i>David</i> surprized <i>Saul</i> sleeping in
the cave, and cut off the skirt of his robe—we read his heart
smote him for what he had done:——But in the matter of
<i>Uriah</i>, where a faithful and gallant servant, whom he ought
to have loved and honoured, fell to make way for his
lust,—where conscience had so much greater reason to take the
alarm, his heart smote him not. A whole year had almost passed “from first commission of that crime, to
the time <i>Nathan</i> was sent to reprove him; and we read not
once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he
testified, during all that time, for what he had done.</p>

<p>“Thus conscience, this once able
monitor,——placed on high as a judge within us, and
intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too,—by an
unhappy train of causes and impediments, takes often such imperfect
cognizance of what passes,——does its office so
negligently,——sometimes so corruptly,—that it is
not to be trusted alone; and therefore we find there is a
necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining another principle with
it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations.</p>

<p>
“So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite
importance to you not to be misled in,—namely, in what degree of real
merit you stand either as an honest man, an useful citizen, a faithful subject
to your king, “or a good servant to your God,——call in
religion and morality.—Look, What is written in the law of
God?——How readest thou?—Consult calm reason and the
unchangeable obligations of justice and truth;——what say they?
</p>

<p>“Let C<small>ONSCIENCE</small> determine the matter
upon these reports;——and then if thy heart condemns
thee not, which is the case the apostle supposes,——the
rule will be infallible;”—[Here Dr. <i>Slop</i> fell
asleep]—“<i>thou wilt have confidence towards
God</i>;——that is, have just grounds to believe the
judgment thou hast past upon thyself, is the judgment of God; and
nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which
will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou
art finally to give an account of thy actions.</p>

<p>“<i>Blessed is the man</i>, indeed, then, as the
author of the book of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> expresses it, <i>who is
not pricked with the multitude of his sins: Blessed is the
man</i> “<i>whose heart hath not condemned him;
whether he be rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good
heart</i> (a heart thus guided and informed) <i>he shall at all
times rejoice in a chearful countenance; his mind shall tell him
more than seven watch-men that sit above upon a tower on
high.”</i>—[A tower has no strength, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, unless ’tis
flank’d.]—“in the darkest doubts it shall
conduct him safer than a thousand casuists, and give the state he
lives in, a better security for his behaviour than all the causes
and restrictions put together, which law-makers are forced to
multiply:—<i>Forced</i>, I say, as things stand; human laws
not being a matter of original choice, but of pure necessity,
brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those
consciences which are no law unto themselves; well intending, by
the many provisions made,—that in all such corrupt and
misguided cases, where principles and the checks of conscience will
not make us upright,—to supply their “force, and, by the terrors of gaols and
halters, oblige us to it.”</p>

<p>[I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been
composed to be preached at the Temple,——or at some
Assize.—I like the reasoning,—and am sorry that Dr.
<i>Slop</i> has fallen asleep before the time of his
conviction:—for it is now clear, that the Parson, as I
thought at first, never insulted St. <i>Paul</i> in the
least;—nor has there been, brother, the least difference
between them.——A great matter, if they had differed,
replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—the best friends in the world
may differ sometimes.——True,—brother <i>Toby</i>
quoth my father, shaking hands with him,—we’ll fill our
pipes, brother, and then <i>Trim</i> shall go on.</p>

<p>Well,——what dost thou think of it? said my father,
speaking to Corporal <i>Trim</i>, as he reached his
tobacco-box.</p>

<p>I think, answered the Corporal, that the seven watch-men upon
the tower, who, I suppose, are all centinels there,—are more,
an’ please your Honour, than were necessary;—and, to go
on at that rate, would harrass a regiment all to pieces, which
a commanding officer, who loves his men, will never do, if he can
help it, because two centinels, added the Corporal, are as good as
twenty.—I have been a commanding officer myself in the
<i>Corps de Garde</i> a hundred times, continued <i>Trim</i>,
rising an inch higher in his figure, as he spoke,—and all the
time I had the honour to serve his Majesty King <i>William</i>, in
relieving the most considerable posts, I never left more than two
in my life.——Very right, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—but you do not consider, <i>Trim</i>, that the
towers, in <i>Solomon</i>’s days, were not such things as our
bastions, flanked and defended by other works;—this,
<i>Trim</i>, was an invention since <i>Solomon</i>’s death;
nor had they horn-works, or ravelins before the curtin, in his
time;——or such a fossé as we make with a cuvette
in the middle of it, and with covered ways and counterscarps
pallisadoed along it, to guard against a <i>Coup de
main</i>:—So that the seven men upon the tower were a party,
I dare say, from the <i>Corps de Garde</i>, set there, not only to
look out, but to defend it.—They could be no more, an’
please your Honour, than a Corporal’s Guard.—My father
smiled inwardly, but not outwardly—the subject being rather
too serious, considering what had happened, to make a jest
of.—So putting his pipe into his mouth, which he had just
lighted,—he contented himself with ordering <i>Trim</i> to
read on. He read on as follows:</p>

<p>“To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in
our mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the
eternal measures of right and wrong:——The first of
these will comprehend the duties of religion;—the second,
those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together,
that you cannot divide these two <i>tables</i>, even in
imagination, (tho’ the attempt is often made in practice)
without breaking and mutually destroying them both.</p>

<p>“I said the attempt is often made; and so it
is;——there being nothing “more common than to see a man who has
no sense at all of religion, and indeed has so much honesty as to
pretend to none, who would take it as the bitterest affront, should
you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character,——or
imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the
uttermost mite.</p>

<p>“When there is some appearance that it is
so,—tho’ one is unwilling even to suspect the
appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were we to
look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we
should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his
motive.</p>

<p>“Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the
subject, it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than
either his interest, his pride, his ease, or some such little and
changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his
actions in matters of great distress.</p>

<p>“I will illustrate this by an example.</p>

<p>“I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I
usually call in,”—[There is no need, cried Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, (waking) to call in any physician in this
case]—“to be neither of them men of much
religion: I hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat all
its sanctions with so much scorn, as to put the matter past doubt.
Well;—notwithstanding this, I put my fortune into the hands
of the one:—and what is dearer still to me, I trust my life
to the honest skill of the other.</p>

<p>“Now let me examine what is my reason for this great
confidence. Why, in the first place, I believe there is no
probability that either of them will employ the power I put into
their hands to my disadvantage;—I consider that honesty
serves the purposes of this life:—I know their success in the
world depends upon the fairness of their characters.—In a
word, I’m persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting
themselves more.</p>

<p>“But put it otherwise, namely, “that interest lay, for once, on the
other side; that a case should happen, wherein the one, without
stain to his reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me
naked in the world;—or that the other could send me out of
it, and enjoy an estate by my death, without dishonour to himself
or his art:—In this case, what hold have I of either of
them?—Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the
question;—Interest, the next most powerful motive in the
world, is strongly against me:——What have I left to
cast into the opposite scale to balance this
temptation?——Alas! I have nothing,——nothing
but what is lighter than a bubble——I must lie at the
mercy of H<small>ONOUR</small>, or some such capricious
principle—Strait security for two of the most valuable
blessings!—my property and myself.</p>

<p>“As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon
morality without religion;—so, on the other hand, there is
nothing better to be expected from “religion without morality;
nevertheless, ’tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral
character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of
himself in the light of a religious man.</p>

<p>“He shall not only be covetous, revengeful,
implacable,—but even wanting in points of common honesty; yet
inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the
age,——is zealous for some points of
religion,——goes twice a day to church,—attends
the sacraments,—and amuses himself with a few instrumental
parts of religion,—shall cheat his conscience into a
judgment, that, for this, he is a religious man, and has discharged
truly his duty to God: And you will find that such a man, through
force of this delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride
upon every other man who has less affectation of
piety,—though, perhaps, ten times more real honesty than
himself.</p>

<p>“<i>This likewise is a sore evil under the</i> “<i>sun</i>; and I believe, there is no one
mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious
mischiefs.——For a general proof of this,—examine
the history of the <i>Romish</i> church;”—[Well what
can you make of that? cried Dr. <i>Slop</i>]—“see
what scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine,
bloodshed,”——[They may thank their own obstinacy,
cried Dr. <i>Slop</i>]——have all been sanctified by a
religion not strictly governed by morality.</p>

<p>
“In how many kingdoms of the world”—[Here <i>Trim</i> kept
waving his right-hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning it
backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.]
</p>

<p>“In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading
sword of this misguided saint-errant, spared neither age or merit,
or sex, or condition?—and, as he fought under the banners of
a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity, he shewed
none; mercilessly trampled upon both,—“heard neither the cries of the
unfortunate, nor pitied their distresses.”</p>

<p>[I have been in many a battle, an’ please your Honour,
quoth <i>Trim</i>, sighing, but never in so melancholy a one as
this,—I would not have drawn a tricker in it against these
poor souls,——to have been made a general
officer.——Why? what do you understand of the affair?
said Dr. <i>Slop</i>, looking towards <i>Trim</i>, with something
more of contempt than the Corporal’s honest heart
deserved.——What do you know, friend, about this battle
you talk of?—I know, replied <i>Trim</i>, that I never
refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for
it;——but to a woman or a child, continued <i>Trim</i>,
before I would level my musket at them, I would loose my life a
thousand times.——Here’s a crown for thee,
<i>Trim</i>, to drink with <i>Obadiah</i> to-night, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, and I’ll give <i>Obadiah</i> another
too.—God bless your Honour, replied
<i>Trim</i>,——I had rather these poor women and
children had it.——thou art an honest fellow, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby.</i>——My father nodded his head, as much as to say—and so
he is.——</p>

<p>But prithee, <i>Trim</i>, said my father, make an end,—for
I see thou hast but a leaf or two left.</p>

<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i> read on.]</p>

<p>“If the testimony of past centuries in this matter
is not sufficient,—consider at this instant, how the votaries
of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to
God, by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to
themselves.</p>

<p>“To be convinced of this, go with me for a moment
into the prisons of the Inquisition.”—[God help my poor
brother <i>Tom.</i>]—“Behold <i>Religion</i>,
with <i>Mercy</i> and <i>Justice</i> chained down under her
feet,——there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal,
propped up with racks and instruments of torment. Hark!—hark!
what a piteous groan!”—[Here <i>Trim</i>’s face
turned as pale as ashes.]——“See the
melancholy wretch who uttered it”—[Here the tears began
to trickle down]——“just brought forth to undergo
the anguish of a mock trial, and endure the utmost pains that a
studied system of cruelty has been able to
invent.”—[D—n them all, quoth <i>Trim</i>, his
colour returning into his face as red as
blood.]—“Behold this helpless victim delivered up
to his tormentors,—his body so wasted with sorrow and
confinement.”—[Oh! ’tis my brother, cried poor
<i>Trim</i> in a most passionate exclamation, dropping the sermon
upon the ground, and clapping his hands together—I fear
’tis poor <i>Tom.</i> My father’s and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s heart yearned with sympathy for the poor
fellow’s distress; even <i>Slop</i> himself acknowledged pity
for him.——Why, <i>Trim</i>, said my father, this is not
a history,——’tis a sermon thou art reading;
prithee begin the sentence again.]——“Behold
this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors,—his body
so wasted with sorrow and confinement, you will see every nerve and
muscle as it suffers.</p>

<p>“Observe the last movement of that horrid
engine!”—[I would rather face a cannon, quoth <i>Trim</i>,
stamping.)—“See what convulsions it has thrown
him into!——Consider the nature of the posture in which
he how lies stretched,—what exquisite tortures he endures by
it!”—[I hope ’tis not in
<i>Portugal.</i>]—“’Tis all nature can
bear! Good God! see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his
trembling lips!” [I would not read another line of it, quoth
<i>Trim</i> for all this <i>world</i>;—I fear, an’
please your Honours, all this is in <i>Portugal</i>, where my poor
brother <i>Tom</i> is. I tell thee, <i>Trim</i>, again, quoth my
father, ’tis not an historical account,—’tis a
description.—’Tis only a description, honest man, quoth
<i>Slop</i>, there’s not a word of truth in
it.——That’s another story, replied my
father.—However, as <i>Trim</i> reads it with so much
concern,—’tis cruelty to force him to go on with
it.—Give me hold of the sermon, <i>Trim</i>,—I’ll
finish it for thee, and thou may’st go. I must stay and hear
it too, replied <i>Trim</i>, if your Honour will allow
me;—tho’ I would not read it myself for a
Colonel’s pay.——Poor Trim! quoth my uncle
<i>Toby.</i> My father went on.]</p>

<p>“——Consider the nature of the posture in which
he now lies stretched,—what exquisite torture he endures by
it!—’Tis all nature can bear! Good God! See how it
keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips,—willing
to take its leave,——but not suffered to
depart!—Behold the unhappy wretch led back to his
cell!”——[Then, thank God, however, quoth
<i>Trim</i>, they have not killed him.]—“See him
dragged out of it again to meet the flames, and the insults in his
last agonies, which this principle,—this principle, that
there can be religion without mercy, has prepared for
him.”——[Then, thank God,——he is dead,
quoth <i>Trim</i>,—he is out of his pain,—and they have
done their worst at him.—O Sirs!—Hold your peace,
<i>Trim</i>, said my father, going on with the sermon, lest
<i>Trim</i> should incense Dr. <i>Slop</i>,—we shall never
have done at this rate.]</p>

<p>“The surest way to try the merit of “any disputed notion is, to trace down
the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare them with
the spirit of Christianity;——’tis the short and
decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us, for these and such
like cases, and it is worth a thousand arguments——<i>By
their fruits ye shall know them.</i></p>

<p>“I will add no farther to the length of this sermon,
than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from
it.</p>

<p>“<i>First</i>, Whenever a man talks loudly against
religion, always suspect that it is not his reason, but his
passions, which have got the better of his C<small>REED</small>. A
bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome
neighbours, and where they separate, depend upon it, ’tis for
no other cause but quietness sake.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly</i>, When a man, thus represented,
tells you in any particular instance,——That such a
thing goes “against his
conscience,——always believe he means exactly the same
thing, as when he tells you such a thing goes <i>against</i> his
stomach;—a present want of appetite being generally the true
cause of both.</p>

<p>“In a word,—trust that man in nothing, who has
not a C<small>ONSCIENCE</small> in every thing.</p>

<p>“And, in your own case, remember this plain
distinction, a mistake in which has ruined thousands,—that
your conscience is not a law;—No, God and reason made the
law, and have placed conscience within you to
determine;——not, like an <i>Asiatic</i> Cadi, according
to the ebbs and flows of his own passions,—but like a
<i>British</i> judge in this land of liberty and good sense, who
makes no new law, but faithfully declares that law which he knows
already written.”</p>

<p class="center">
<i>F&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;S.</i>
</p>

<p>Thou hast read the sermon extremely well, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my
father.—If he had spared his comments, replied Dr.
<i>Slop</i>,——he would have read it much better.</p>

<p>I should have read it ten times better, Sir, answered
<i>Trim</i>, but that my heart was so full.—That was the very
reason, <i>Trim</i>, replied my father, which has made thee read
the sermon as well as thou hast done; and if the clergy of our
church, continued my father, addressing himself to Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow
has done,—as their compositions are fine;—[I deny it,
quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>]—I maintain it,—that the
eloquence of our pulpits, with such subjects to enflame it, would
be a model for the whole world:——But alas! continued my
father, and I own it, Sir, with sorrow, that, like <i>French</i>
politicians in this respect, what they gain in the cabinet they
lose in the field.——’Twere a pity, quoth my
uncle, that this should be lost. I like the sermon well, replied my
father,——’tis dramatick,—and there is
something in that way of writing, when skilfully managed, which
catches the attention.——We preach much in that way with
us, said Dr. <i>Slop.</i>—I know that very well, said my
father,—but in a tone and manner which disgusted Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, full as much as his assent, simply, could have pleased
him.——But in this, added Dr. <i>Slop</i>, a little
piqued,—our sermons have greatly the advantage, that we never
introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a
patriarch’s wife, or a martyr or a saint.—There are
some very bad characters in this, however, said my father, and I do
not think the sermon a jot the worse for
’em.——But pray, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—who’s can this be?—How could it get
into my <i>Stevinus</i>? A man must be as great a conjurer as
<i>Stevinus</i>, said my father, to resolve the second
question:—The first, I think, is not so difficult;—for
unless my judgment greatly deceives me,——I know the
author, for ’tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the
parish.</p>

<p>The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father constantly had heard
preached in his parish-church, was the ground of his
conjecture,—proving it as strongly, as an argument
<i>à priori</i> could prove such a thing to a philosophic
mind, That it was <i>Yorick</i>’s and no one’s
else:—It was proved to be so, <i>à posteriori</i>, the
day after, when <i>Yorick</i> sent a servant to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s house to enquire after it.</p>

<p>It seems that <i>Yorick</i>, who was inquisitive after all kinds
of knowledge, had borrowed <i>Stevinus</i> of my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
and had carelesly popped his sermon, as soon as he had made it,
into the middle of <i>Stevinus</i>; and by an act of forgetfulness,
to which he was ever subject, he had sent <i>Stevinus</i> home, and
his sermon to keep him company.</p>

<p>Ill-fated sermon! Thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a
second time, dropped thru’ an unsuspected fissure in thy
master’s pocket, down into a treacherous and a tattered
lining,—trod deep into the dirt by the left hind-foot of
his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou
falledst;—buried ten days in the mire,——raised up
out of it by a beggar,—sold for a halfpenny to a
parish-clerk,——transferred to his
parson,——lost for ever to thy own, the remainder of his
days,—nor restored to his restless M<small>ANES</small> till
this very moment, that I tell the world the story.</p>

<p>Can the reader believe, that this sermon of
<i>Yorick</i>’s was preached at an assize, in the cathedral
of <i>York</i>, before a thousand witnesses, ready to give oath of
it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually printed by
him when he had done,——and within so short a space as
two years and three months after <i>Yorick</i>’s
death?—<i>Yorick</i> indeed, was never better served in his
life;——but it was a little hard to maltreat him after,
and plunder him after he was laid in his grave.</p>

<p>However, as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with
<i>Yorick</i>,—and, in conscious justice, printed but a few copies to give away;—and that I am told he
could moreover have made as good a one himself, had he thought
fit,—I declare I would not have published this anecdote to
the world;——nor do I publish it with an intent to hurt
his character and advancement in the church;—I leave that to
others;——but I find myself impelled by two reasons,
which I cannot withstand.</p>

<p>The first is, That in doing justice, I may give rest to
<i>Yorick</i>’s ghost;——which—as the
country-people, and some others believe,——<i>still
walks.</i></p>

<p>The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the
world, I gain an opportunity of informing it,—That in case
the character of parson <i>Yorick</i>, and this sample of his
sermons, is liked,——there are now in the possession of
the <i>Shandy</i> family, as many as will make a handsome volume,
at the world’s service,——and much good may they
do it.</p>

</h3>

<p>O<small>BADIAH</small> gained the two crowns without
dispute;—for he came in jingling, with all the instruments in
the green baize bag we spoke of, flung across his body, just as
Corporal <i>Trim</i> went out of the room.</p>

<p>It is now proper, I think, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, (clearing up
his looks) as we are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs.
<i>Shandy</i>, to send up stairs to know how she goes on.</p>

<p>I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down
to us upon the least difficulty;—for you must know, Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, continued my father, with a perplexed kind of a smile
upon his countenance, that by express treaty, solemnly ratified
between me and my wife, you are no more than an auxiliary in this
affair,—and not so much as that,—unless the lean old
mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.—Women have their particular fancies, and in points
of this nature, continued my father, where they bear the whole
burden, and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our
families, and the good of the species,—they claim a right of
deciding, <i>en Souveraines</i>, in whose hands, and in what
fashion, they choose to undergo it.</p>

<p>They are in the right of it,——quoth my uncle
<i>Toby.</i> But Sir, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, not taking notice of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s opinion, but turning to my
father,—they had better govern in other
points;——and a father of a family, who wishes its
perpetuity, in my opinion, had better exchange this prerogative
with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of
it.——I know not, quoth my father, answering a letter
too testily, to be quite dispassionate in what he said,—I
know not, quoth he, what we have left to give up, in lieu of who
shall bring our children into the world, unless that,—of who
shall beget them.——One would almost give up any thing, replied Dr.
<i>Slop.</i>—I beg your pardon,——answered my
uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Sir, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, it would
astonish you to know what improvements we have made of late years
in all branches of obstetrical knowledge, but particularly in that
one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the
<i>fœtus</i>,——which has received such lights,
that, for my part (holding up his hand) I declare I wonder how the
world has——I wish, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, you had
seen what prodigious armies we had in <i>Flanders.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIV</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAVE</small> dropped the curtain over this
scene for a minute,——to remind you of one
thing,——and to inform you of another.</p>

<p>What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due
course;——for it should have been told a hundred and
fifty pages ago, but that I foresaw then ’twould come in pat hereafter, and be of
more advantage here than elsewhere.——Writers had need
look before them, to keep up the spirit and connection of what they
have in hand.</p>

<p>When these two things are done,—the curtain shall be drawn
up again, and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, my father, and Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
shall go on with their discourse, without any more
interruption.</p>

<p>First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is
this;——that from the specimens of singularity in my
father’s notions in the point of Christian-names, and that
other previous point thereto,—you was led, I think, into an
opinion,—(and I am sure I said as much) that my father was a
gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.
In truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very
first act of his begetting,——down to the lean and
slippered pantaloon in his second childishness, but he had some
favourite notion to himself, springing out of it, as sceptical, and
as far out of the high-way of thinking, as these two which have been
explained.</p>

<p>—Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, my father, Sir, would see nothing in
the light in which others placed it;—he placed things in his
own light;—he would weigh nothing in common scales;—no,
he was too refined a researcher to lie open to so gross an
imposition.—To come at the exact weight of things in the
scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost
invisible, to avoid all friction from popular tenets;—without
this the minutiæ of philosophy, which would always turn the
balance, will have no weight at all. Knowledge, like matter, he
would affirm, was divisible <i>in infinitum</i>;——that
the grains and scruples were as much a part of it, as the
gravitation of the whole world.—In a word, he would say,
error was error,—no matter where it
fell,——whether in a fraction,——or a
pound,—’twas alike fatal to truth, and she was kept
down at the bottom of her well, as inevitably by a mistake in the
dust of a butterfly’s wing,——as in the disk
of the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven put
together.</p>

<p>He would often lament that it was for want of considering this
properly, and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as
to speculative truths, that so many things in this world were out
of joint;——that the political arch was giving
way;——and that the very foundations of our excellent
constitution in church and state, were so sapped as estimators had
reported.</p>

<p>You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people. Why?
he would ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism of <i>Zeno</i>
and <i>Chrysippus</i>, without knowing it belonged to
them.—Why? why are we a ruined people?—Because we are
corrupted.—Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are
corrupted?——Because we are needy;——our
poverty, and not our wills, consent.——And wherefore, he
would add, are we needy?—From the neglect, he would answer,
of our pence and our halfpence:—Our bank notes, Sir, our guineas,—nay our shillings
take care of themselves.</p>

<p>’Tis the same, he would say, throughout the whole circle
of the sciences;—the great, the established points of them,
are not to be broke in upon.—The laws of nature will defend
themselves;—but error——(he would add, looking
earnestly at my mother)——error, Sir, creeps in
thro’ the minute holes and small crevices which human nature
leaves unguarded.</p>

<p>This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you
of:—The point you are to be informed of, and which I have
reserved for this place, is as follows.</p>

<p>Amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had
urged my mother to accept of Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s assistance
preferably to that of the old woman,——there was one of
a very singular nature; which, when he had done arguing the matter
with her as a Christian, and came to argue it over again with her as a philosopher, he had put his
whole strength to, depending indeed upon it as his
sheet-anchor.——It failed him, tho’ from no defect
in the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was not able
for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of
it.——Cursed luck!——said he to himself, one
afternoon, as he walked out of the room, after he had been stating
it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of
purpose;—cursed luck! said he, biting his lip as he shut the
door,——for a man to be master of one of the finest
chains of reasoning in nature,——and have a wife at the
same time with such a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single
inference within side of it, to save his soul from destruction.</p>

<p>This argument, though it was entirely lost upon my
mother,——had more weight with him, than all his other
arguments joined together:—I will therefore endeavour to do
it justice,—and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am
master of.</p>

<p>My father set out upon the strength of these two following
axioms:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That an ounce of a man’s own wit, was worth
a ton of other people’s; and,</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, (Which by the bye, was the ground-work of the
first axiom,——tho’ it comes last) That every
man’s wit must come from every man’s own
soul,——and no other body’s.</p>

<p>Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature
equal,——and that the great difference between the most
acute and the most obtuse understanding——was from no
original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or
below another,——but arose merely from the lucky or
unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul
principally took up her residence,——he had made it the
subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place.</p>

<p>Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this
matter, he was satisfied it could not be where <i>Des
Cartes</i> had fixed it, upon the top of the <i>pineal</i>
gland of the brain; which, as he philosophized, formed a cushion
for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho’ to speak the
truth, as so many nerves did terminate all in that one
place,—’twas no bad conjecture;——and my
father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into
the centre of the mistake, had it not been for my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, who rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a
<i>Walloon</i> officer at the battle of <i>Landen</i>, who had one
part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,—and another
part of it taken out after by a <i>French</i> surgeon; and after
all, recovered, and did his duty very well without it.</p>

<p>If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but
the separation of the soul from the body;—and if it is true
that people can walk about and do their business without
brains,—then certes the soul does not inhabit there.
Q.E.D.</p>

<p>As for that certain, very thin, subtle and very fragrant juice
which <i>Coglionissimo Borri</i>, the great <i>Milaneze</i>
physician affirms, in a letter to <i>Bartholine</i>, to have
discovered in the cellulæ of the occipital parts of the
cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat
of the reasonable soul, (for, you must know, in these latter and
more enlightened ages, there are two souls in every man
living,—the one, according to the great <i>Metheglingius</i>,
being called the <i>Animus</i>, the other, the
<i>Anima</i>;)—as for the opinion, I say of
<i>Borri</i>,—my father could never subscribe to it by any
means; the very idea of so noble, so refined, so immaterial, and so
exalted a being as the <i>Anima</i>, or even the <i>Animus</i>,
taking up her residence, and sitting dabbling, like a tad-pole all
day long, both summer and winter, in a puddle,——or in a
liquid of any kind, how thick or thin soever, he would say, shocked
his imagination; he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing.</p>

<p>What, therefore, seemed the least liable to objections of any,
was that the chief sensorium, or head-quarters of the soul, and to which place all intelligences were
referred, and from whence all her mandates were issued,—was
in, or near, the cerebellum,—or rather somewhere about the
<i>medulla oblongata</i>, wherein it was generally agreed by
<i>Dutch</i> anatomists, that all the minute nerves from all the
organs of the seven senses concentered, like streets and winding
alleys, into a square.</p>

<p>So far there was nothing singular in my father’s
opinion,—he had the best of philosophers, of all ages and
climates, to go along with him.——But here he took a
road of his own, setting up another <i>Shandean</i> hypothesis upon
these corner-stones they had laid for him;——and which
said hypothesis equally stood its ground; whether the subtilty and
fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness of
the said liquor, or of the finer net-work and texture in the
cerebellum itself; which opinion he favoured.</p>

<p>He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act
of propagation of each individual, which required all the thought
in the world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible
contexture, in which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is
usually meant by the name of good natural parts, do
consist;—that next to this and his Christian-name, which were
the two original and most efficacious causes of
all;——that the third cause, or rather what logicians
call the <i>Causa sina qua non</i>, and without which all that was
done was of no manner of significance,——was the
preservation of this delicate and fine-spun web, from the havock
which was generally made in it by the violent compression and crush
which the head was made to undergo, by the nonsensical method of
bringing us into the world by that foremost.</p>

<p>——This requires explanation.</p>

<p>
My father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into <i>Lithopædus
Senonesis de Portu difficili</i>,<a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> published by <i>Adrianus Smelvgot</i>,
had found out, that the lax and pliable state of a child’s head in
parturition, the bones of the cranium having no sutures at that time, was
such,——that by force of the woman’s efforts, which, in strong
labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to the weight of 470 pounds
avoirdupois acting perpendicularly upon it;—it so happened, that in 49
instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of
an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a pastry-cook generally rolls up in
order to make a pye of.—Good God! cried my father, what havock and
destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the
cerebellum!—Or if there is such a juice as <i>Borri</i> pretends—is
it not enough to make the clearest liquid in the world both seculent and
mothery?
</p>

<p>But how great was his apprehension, when he farther understood,
that this force acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only
injured the brain itself, or cerebrum,—but that it
necessarily squeezed and propelled the cerebrum towards the
cerebellum, which was the immediate seat of the
understanding!——Angels and ministers of grace defend
us! cried my father,——can any soul withstand this
shock?—No wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tattered
as we see it; and that so many of our best heads are no better than
a puzzled skein of silk,——all
perplexity,——all confusion within-side.</p>

<p>But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that
when a child was turned topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator
to do, and was extracted by the feet;—that instead of the
cerebrum being propelled towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on
the contrary, was propelled simply towards the cerebrum, where it could
do no manner of hurt:——By heavens! cried he, the world
is in conspiracy to drive out what little wit God has given
us,——and the professors of the obstetric art are listed
into the same conspiracy.—What is it to me which end of my
son comes foremost into the world, provided all goes right after,
and his cerebellum escapes uncrushed?</p>

<p>It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived
it, that it assimilates every thing to itself, as proper
nourishment; and, from the first moment of your begetting it, it
generally grows the stronger by every thing you see, hear, read, or
understand. This is of great use.</p>

<p>When my father was gone with this about a month, there was
scarce a phænomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could
not readily solve by it;—it accounted for the eldest son
being the greatest blockhead in the family.——Poor
devil, he would say,—he made way for the capacity of his
younger brothers.——It unriddled the observations of
drivellers and monstrous heads,——shewing <i>à
priori</i>, it could not be otherwise,——unless **** I
don’t know what. It wonderfully explained and accounted for
the acumen of the <i>Asiatic</i> genius, and that sprightlier turn,
and a more penetrating intuition of minds, in warmer climates; not
from the loose and common-place solution of a clearer sky, and a
more perpetual sunshine, &amp;c.—which for aught he knew,
might as well rarefy and dilute the faculties of the soul into
nothing, by one extreme,—as they are condensed in colder
climates by the other;——but he traced the affair up to
its spring-head;—shewed that, in warmer climates, nature had
laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the
creation;—their pleasures more;—the necessity of their
pains less, insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the
vertex was so slight, that the whole organization of the cerebellum
was preserved;——nay, he did not believe, in natural
births, that so much as a single thread of the network was broke or displaced,——so that
the soul might just act as she liked.</p>

<p>When my father had got so far,——what a blaze of
light did the accounts of the <i>Caesarian</i> section, and of the
towering geniuses who had come safe into the world by it, cast upon
this hypothesis? Here you see, he would say, there was no injury
done to the sensorium;—no pressure of the head against the
pelvis;——no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the
cerebellum, either by the <i>os pubis</i> on this side, or <i>os
coxygis</i> on that;——and pray, what were the happy
consequences? Why, Sir, your <i>Julius Caesar</i>, who gave the
operation a name;—and your <i>Hermes Trismegistus</i>, who
was born so before ever the operation had a name;——your
<i>Scipio Africanus</i>; your <i>Manlius Torquatus</i>; our
<i>Edward</i> the Sixth,—who, had he lived, would have done
the same honour to the hypothesis:——These, and many
more who figured high in the annals of fame,—all came
<i>side-way</i>, Sir, into the world.</p>

<p>The incision of the <i>abdomen</i> and <i>uterus</i> ran for six weeks together in my father’s
head;——he had read, and was satisfied, that wounds in
the <i>epigastrium</i>, and those in the <i>matrix</i>, were not
mortal;—so that the belly of the mother might be opened
extremely well to give a passage to the child.—He mentioned
the thing one afternoon to my mother,——merely as a
matter of fact; but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very
mention of it, as much as the operation flattered his
hopes,—he thought it as well to say no more of
it,——contenting himself with admiring,—what he
thought was to no purpose to propose.</p>

<p>This was my father Mr. <i>Shandy</i>’s hypothesis;
concerning which I have only to add, that my brother <i>Bobby</i>
did as great honour to it (whatever he did to the family) as any
one of the great heroes we spoke of: For happening not only to be
christened, as I told you, but to be born too, when my father was
at <i>Epsom</i>,——being moreover my mother’s
first child,—coming into the world with his head
<i>foremost</i>,—and turning out afterwards a lad of wonderful slow
parts,——my father spelt all these together into his
opinion: and as he had failed at one end,—he was determined
to try the other.</p>

<p>This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are
not easily to be put out of their way,——and was
therefore one of my father’s great reasons in favour of a man
of science, whom he could better deal with.</p>

<p>Of all men in the world, Dr. <i>Slop</i> was the fittest for my
father’s purpose;——for though this new-invented
forceps was the armour he had proved, and what he maintained to be
the safest instrument of deliverance, yet, it seems, he had
scattered a word or two in his book, in favour of the very thing
which ran in my father’s fancy;——tho’ not
with a view to the soul’s good in extracting by the feet, as
was my father’s system,—but for reasons merely
obstetrical.</p>

<p>This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, in the ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——In what
manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could bear up
against two such allies in science,—is hard to
conceive.—You may conjecture upon it, if you
please,——and whilst your imagination is in motion, you
may encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and effects
in nature it could come to pass, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> got his
modesty by the wound he received upon his groin.—You may
raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by
marriage-articles,—and shew the world how it could happen,
that I should have the misfortune to be called
T<small>RISTRAM</small>, in opposition to my father’s
hypothesis, and the wish of the whole family, Godfathers and
Godmothers not excepted.—These, with fifty other points left
yet unravelled, you may endeavour to solve if you have
time;——but I tell you beforehand it will be in vain,
for not the sage <i>Alquise</i>, the magician in Don
<i>Belianis</i> of <i>Greece</i>, nor the no less famous
<i>Urganda</i>, the sorceress his wife, (were they alive) could pretend to come within a league of the truth.</p>

<p>The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of
these matters till the next year,——when a series of
things will be laid open which he little expects.</p>

The author is here twice mistaken; for <i>Lithopædus</i> should be wrote thus,
<i>Lithopædii Senonensis Icon.</i> The second mistake is, that this
<i>Lithopædus</i> is not an author, but a drawing of a petrified child. The
account of this, published by <i>Athosius</i> 1580, may be seen at the end of
<i>Cordæus</i>’s works in <i>Spachius.</i> Mr. <i>Tristram Shandy</i> has
been led into this error, either from seeing <i>Lithopædus</i>’s name of
late in a catalogue of learned writers in Dr. ——, or by mistaking
<i>Lithopædus</i> for <i>Trinecavellius</i>,—from the too great
similitude of the names.

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLV</small>
</h3>

<p>
——“I <i><small>WISH</small></i>, Dr. <i>Slop</i>,”
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, (repeating his wish for Dr. <i>Slop</i> a second
time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in his manner of wishing,
than he had wished at first<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>)——“<i>I wish, Dr.
Slop,”</i> quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, “<i>you had seen what
prodigious armies we had in</i> Flanders.”
</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>’s wish did Dr. <i>Slop</i> a
disservice which his heart never intended any man,—Sir, it
confounded him——and thereby putting his ideas first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not
rally them again for the soul of him.</p>

<p>In all disputes,——male or
female,&nbsp;—whether for honour, for profit, or for
love,—it makes no difference in the case;—nothing is
more dangerous, Madam, than a wish coming sideways in this
unexpected manner upon a man: the safest way in general to take off
the force of the wish, is for the party wish’d at, instantly
to get upon his legs—and wish the <i>wisher</i> something in
return, of pretty near the same value,——so balancing
the account upon the spot, you stand as you were—nay
sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by it.</p>

<p>This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of
wishes.—</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Slop</i> did not understand the nature of this
defence;—he was puzzled with it, and it put an entire stop to
the dispute for four minutes and a half;—five had been fatal
to it:—my father saw the danger—the dispute was one of
the most interesting disputes in the world, “Whether the child of his prayers and
endeavours should be born without a head or with
one:”—he waited to the last moment, to allow Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, in whose behalf the wish was made, his right of
returning it; but perceiving, I say, that he was confounded, and
continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled
souls generally stare with—first in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s face—then in his—then up—then
down—then east—east and by east, and so
on,——coasting it along by the plinth of the wainscot
till he had got to the opposite point of the
compass,——and that he had actually begun to count the
brass nails upon the arm of his chair,—my father thought
there was no time to be lost with my uncle <i>Toby</i>, so took up
the discourse as follows.</p>

<p class="footnote">

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVI</small>
</h3>

<p>“—W<small>HAT</small> prodigious armies
you had in <i>Flanders!</i>”—&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brother <i>Toby</i>, replied my father, taking his wig from off
his head with his right hand, and with his <i>left</i> pulling out a
striped <i>India</i> handkerchief from his right coat pocket, in
order to rub his head, as he argued the point with my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——</p>

<p>——Now, in this I think my father was much to blame;
and I will give you my reasons for it.</p>

<p>Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than,
“<i>Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his
right hand or with his left</i>,”—have divided the
greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed
them, to totter upon their heads.——But need I tell you,
Sir, that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is
begirt, give every thing in this world its size and
shape!—and by tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or
that, make the thing to be, what it
is—great—little—good—bad—indifferent
or not indifferent, just as the case happens?</p>

<p>As my father’s <i>India</i> handkerchief was in his right
coat pocket, he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged: on the contrary, instead of
taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to have committed
that entirely to the left; and then, when the natural exigency my
father was under of rubbing his head, called out for his
handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world to have done,
but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken
it out;——which he might have done without any violence,
or the least ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his
whole body.</p>

<p>In this case, (unless, indeed, my father had been resolved to
make a fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left
hand——or by making some nonsensical angle or other at
his elbow-joint, or armpit)—his whole attitude had been
easy—natural—unforced: <i>Reynolds</i> himself, as
great and gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he
sat.</p>

<p>Now as my father managed this matter,—consider what a
devil of a figure my father made of himself.</p>

<p>In the latter end of Queen <i>Anne</i>’s reign, and in the beginning of the reign of King
<i>George</i> the first—“<i>Coat pockets were cut very
low down in the skirt.</i>”—I need say no
more—the father of mischief, had he been hammering at it a
month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my
father’s situation.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was not an easy matter in any
king’s reign (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to
have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so
as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket.——In
the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this
happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle
<i>Toby</i> discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my
father’s approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his
mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of <i>St.
Nicolas</i>;—the idea of which drew off his attention so
intirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right
hand to the bell to ring up <i>Trim</i> to go and fetch
his map of <i>Namur</i>, and his compasses and sector along with
it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that
attack,—but particularly of that one, where he received his
wound upon his groin.</p>

<p>My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in
his body seemed to rush up into his face——my uncle
<i>Toby</i> dismounted immediately.</p>

<p>——I did not apprehend your uncle <i>Toby</i> was
o’horseback.——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>A <small>MAN</small>’s body and his mind, with
the utmost reverence to both I speak it, are exactly like a jerkin,
and a jerkin’s lining;—rumple the one,—you rumple
the other. There is one certain exception however in this case, and
that is, when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your
jerkin made of gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it of a
sarcenet, or thin persian.</p>

<p><i>Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes Babylonius, Dionysius,
Heracleotes, Antipater, Panætius</i>, and <i>Possidonius</i>
amongst the <i>Greeks</i>;——<i>Cato</i> and
<i>Varro</i> and <i>Seneca</i> amongst the
<i>Romans</i>;——<i>Pantenus</i> and <i>Clemens
Alexandrinus</i> and <i>Montaigne</i> amongst the Christians; and a
score and a half of good, honest, unthinking <i>Shandean</i> people
as ever lived, whose names I can’t recollect,—all
pretended that their jerkins were made after this
fashion,—you might have rumpled and crumpled, and doubled and
creased, and fretted and fridged the outside of them all to
pieces;——in short, you might have played the very devil
with them, and at the same time, not one of the insides of them
would have been one button the worse, for all you had done to
them.</p>

<p>I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after
this sort:——for never poor jerkin has been tickled off
at such a rate as it has been these last nine months
together,——and yet I declare, the lining to
it,——as far as I am a judge of the
matter,——is not a three-penny piece the worse;—pell-mell,
helter-skelter, ding-dong, cut and thrust, back stroke and fore
stroke, side way and long-way, have they been trimming it for
me:—had there been the least gumminess in my lining,—by
heaven! it had all of it long ago been frayed and fretted to a
thread.</p>

<p>——You Messrs. the Monthly
Reviewers!——how could you cut and slash my jerkin as
you did?——how did you know but you would cut my lining
too?</p>

<p>Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who
will injure none of us, do I recommend you and your
affairs,—so God bless you;—only next month, if any one
of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at me, as some of
you did last M<small>AY</small> (in which I remember the weather
was very hot)—don’t be exasperated, if I pass it by
again with good temper,—being determined as long as I live or
write) which in my case means the same thing) never to give the
honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish than my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave
the fly which buzz’d about his nose all
<i>dinner-time</i>,——“Go,—go, poor
devil,” quoth he,—“get thee gone,—why
should I hurt thee! This world is surely wide enough to hold both
thee and me.”</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIX</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>NY</small> man, Madam, reasoning upwards,
and observing the prodigious suffusion of blood in my
father’s countenance,—by means of which (as all the
blood in his body seemed to rush into his face, as I told you) he
must have reddened, pictorically and scientifically speaking, six
whole tints and a half, if not a full octave above his natural
colour:—any man, Madam, but my uncle <i>Toby</i>, who had
observed this, together with the violent knitting of my
father’s brows, and the extravagant contortion of his body
during the whole affair,—would have concluded my father in a
rage; and taking that for granted,—had he been a lover of such kind of concord as arises
from two such instruments being put in exact tune,—he would
instantly have skrew’d up his, to the same pitch;—and
then the devil and all had broke loose—the whole piece,
Madam, must have been played off like the sixth of Avison
Scarlatti—<i>con furia</i>,—like mad.—Grant me
patience!——What has <i>con
furia</i>,——<i>con strepito</i>,——or any
other hurly burly whatever to do with harmony?</p>

<p>Any man, I say, Madam, but my uncle <i>Toby</i>, the benignity
of whose heart interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest
sense the motion would admit of, would have concluded my father
angry, and blamed him too. My uncle <i>Toby</i> blamed nothing but
the taylor who cut the pocket-hole;——so sitting still
till my father had got his handkerchief out of it, and looking all
the time up in his face with inexpressible
good-will——my father, at length, went on as
follows.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;L</small>
</h3>

<p>“W<small>HAT</small> prodigious armies
you had in <i>Flanders!</i>”</p>

<p>——Brother <i>Toby</i>, quoth my father, I do believe
thee to be as honest a man, and with as good and as upright a heart
as ever God created;—nor is it thy fault, if all the children
which have been, may, can, shall, will, or ought to be begotten,
come with their heads foremost into the world:——but
believe me, dear <i>Toby</i>, the accidents which unavoidably
way-lay them, not only in the article of our begetting
’em——though these, in my opinion, are well worth
considering,——but the dangers and difficulties our
children are beset with, after they are got forth into the world,
are enow—little need is there to expose them to unnecessary
ones in their passage to it.——Are these dangers, quoth
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, laying his hand upon my father’s knee,
and looking up seriously in his face for an
answer,——are these dangers greater now
o’days, brother, than in times past? Brother <i>Toby</i>,
answered my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born
alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after it,—our
forefathers never looked farther.——My uncle <i>Toby</i>
instantly withdrew his hand from off my father’s knee,
reclined his body gently back in his chair, raised his head till he
could just see the cornice of the room, and then directing the
buccinatory muscles along his cheeks, and the orbicular muscles
around his lips to do their duty—he whistled
<i>Lillabullero.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LI</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HILST</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> was
whistling <i>Lillabullero</i> to my father,—Dr. <i>Slop</i>
was stamping, and cursing and damning at <i>Obadiah</i> at a most
dreadful rate,——it would have done your heart good, and
cured you, Sir, for ever of the vile sin of swearing, to have heard
him, I am determined therefore to relate the whole affair to
you.</p>

<p>When Dr. <i>Slop</i>’s maid delivered the green baize bag
with her master’s instruments in it, to <i>Obadiah</i>, she
very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through the
strings, and ride with it slung across his body: so undoing the
bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without any more ado,
she helped him on with it. However, as this, in some measure,
unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in
galloping back, at the speed <i>Obadiah</i> threatened, they
consulted to take it off again: and in the great care and caution
of their hearts, they had taken the two strings and tied them close
(pursing up the mouth of the bag first) with half a dozen hard
knots, each of which <i>Obadiah</i>, to make all safe, had twitched
and drawn together with all the strength of his body.</p>

<p>This answered all that <i>Obadiah</i> and the maid intended; but
was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw.
The instruments, it seems, as tight as the bag was tied above,
had so much room to play in it, towards the bottom (the
shape of the bag being conical) that <i>Obadiah</i> could not make
a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the
<i>tire téte, forceps</i>, and <i>squirt</i>, as would have
been enough, had <i>Hymen</i> been taking a jaunt that way, to have
frightened him out of the country; but when <i>Obadiah</i>
accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his
coach-horse into a full gallop——by Heaven! Sir, the
jingle was incredible.</p>

<p>As <i>Obadiah</i> had a wife and three children——the
turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill
consequences of this jingling, never once entered his
brain,——he had however his objection, which came home
to himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with the
greatest patriots.——“<i>The poor fellow, Sir, was
not able to hear himself whistle.</i>”</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> <i>Obadiah</i> loved wind-music
preferably to all the instrumental music he carried with
him,—he very considerately set his imagination to work, to
contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a
condition of enjoying it.</p>

<p>In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted,
nothing is so apt to enter a man’s head as his
hat-band:——the philosophy of this is so near the
surface——I scorn to enter into it.</p>

<p>As <i>Obadiah</i>’s was a mixed case——mark,
Sirs,——I say, a mixed case; for it was
obstetrical,——<i>scrip</i>-tical, squirtical,
papistical——and as far as the coach-horse was concerned
in it,——caballistical——and only partly
musical;—<i>Obadiah</i> made no scruple of availing himself
of the first expedient which offered; so taking hold of the bag and
instruments, and griping them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb
of the other putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and
then slipping his hand down to the middle of it,—he tied and
cross-tied them all fast together from one end to the other (as you
would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and
intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every intersection or
point where the strings met,—that Dr. <i>Slop</i> must have
had three fifths of <i>Job</i>’s patience at least to have
unloosed them.—I think in my conscience, that had
N<small>ATURE</small> been in one of her nimble moods, and in
humour for such a contest——and she and Dr. <i>Slop</i>
both fairly started together——there is no man living
which had seen the bag with all that <i>Obadiah</i> had done to
it,——and known likewise the great speed the Goddess can
make when she thinks proper, who would have had the least doubt
remaining in his mind—which of the two would have carried off
the prize. My mother, Madam, had been delivered sooner than the
green bag infallibly——at least by twenty <i>knots.</i>——Sport
of small accidents, <i>Tristram Shandy!</i> that thou art, and ever
will be! had that trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but
it had,——thy affairs had not been so
depress’d—(at least by the depression of thy nose) as
they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions
of making them, which have so often presented themselves in the
course of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so
tamely, so irrecoverably abandoned—as thou hast been forced
to leave them;——but ’tis over,——all
but the account of ’em, which cannot be given to the curious
till I am got out into the world.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp; &nbsp;I</small>
</h3>

<p>G<small>REAT</small> wits jump: for the moment Dr.
<i>Slop</i> cast his eyes upon his bag (which he had not done till
the dispute with my uncle <i>Toby</i> about mid-wifery put him in
mind of it)—the very same thought occurred.—’Tis
God’s mercy, quoth he (to himself) that Mrs. <i>Shandy</i>
has had so bad a time of it,——else she might have been
brought to bed seven times told, before one half of these knots
could have got untied.——But here you must
distinguish—the thought floated only in Dr.
<i>Slop</i>’s mind, without sail or ballast to it, as a
simple proposition; millions of which, as your worship knows, are
every day swimming quietly in the middle of the thin juice of a
man’s understanding, without being carried backwards or
forwards, till some little gusts of passion or interest drive them
to one side.</p>

<p>A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother’s
bed, did the proposition the very service I am speaking of. By all
that’s unfortunate, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, unless I make
haste, the thing will actually befall me as it is.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;II</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> the case of <i>knots</i>,—by
which, in the first place, I would not be understood to mean
slip-knots—because in the course of my life and
opinions—my opinions concerning them will come in more
properly when I mention the catastrophe of my great uncle Mr.
<i>Hammond Shandy</i>,—a little man,—but of high
fancy:—he rushed into the duke of <i>Monmouth</i>’s
affair:——nor, secondly, in this place, do I mean that
particular species of knots called bow-knots;—there is so little address, or skill, or patience required in
the unloosing them, that they are below my giving any opinion at
all about them.—But by the knots I am speaking of, may it
please your reverences to believe, that I mean good, honest,
devilish tight, hard knots, made <i>bona fide</i>, as
<i>Obadiah</i> made his;——in which there is no
quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the two
ends of the strings thro’ the annulus or noose made by the
second <i>implication</i> of them—to get them slipp’d
and undone by.——I hope you apprehend me.</p>

<p>In the case of these <i>knots</i> then, and of the several
obstructions, which, may it please your reverences, such knots cast
in our way in getting through life——every hasty man can
whip out his pen-knife and cut through
them.——’Tis wrong. Believe me, Sirs, the most
virtuous way, and which both reason and conscience
dictate——is to take our teeth or our fingers to
them.——Dr. <i>Slop</i> had lost his teeth—his
favourite instrument, by extracting in a wrong direction, or by some misapplication of it,
unfortunately slipping, he had formerly, in a hard labour,
knock’d out three of the best of them with the handle of
it:——he tried his fingers—alas; the nails of his
fingers and thumbs were cut close.—The duce take it! I can
make nothing of it either way, cried Dr.
<i>Slop.</i>——The trampling over head near my
mother’s bed-side increased.—Pox take the fellow! I
shall never get the knots untied as long as I live.——My
mother gave a groan.——Lend me your penknife—I
must e’en cut the knots at
last——pugh!——psha!—Lord! I have cut
my thumb quite across to the very bone——curse the
fellow—if there was not another man-midwife within fifty
miles——I am undone for this bout—I wish the
scoundrel hang’d—I wish he was shot——I wish
all the devils in hell had him for a blockhead!——</p>

<p>My father had a great respect for <i>Obadiah</i>, and could not
bear to hear him disposed of in such a manner—he had moreover
some little respect for himself—and could as ill bear with the indignity
offered to himself in it.</p>

<p>Had Dr. <i>Slop</i> cut any part about him, but his
thumb——my father had pass’d it by—his
prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his
revenge.</p>

<p>Small curses, Dr. <i>Slop</i>, upon great occasions, quoth my
father (condoling with him first upon the accident) are but so much
waste of our strength and soul’s health to no manner of
purpose.—I own it, replied Dr. <i>Slop.</i>—They are
like sparrow-shot, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> (suspending his
whistling) fired against a bastion.——They serve,
continued my father, to stir the humours——but carry off
none of their acrimony:—for my own part, I seldom swear or
curse at all—I hold it bad——but if I fall into it
by surprize, I generally retain so much presence of mind (right,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>) as to make it answer my
purpose——that is, I swear on till I find myself easy. A
wife and a just man however would always endeavour to
proportion the vent given to these humours, not only to the
degree of them stirring within himself—but to the size and
ill intent of the offence upon which they are to
fall.—“<i>Injuries come only from the
heart</i>,”—quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i> For this
reason, continued my father, with the most <i>Cervantick</i>
gravity, I have the greatest veneration in the world for that
gentleman, who, in distrust of his own discretion in this point,
sat down and composed (that is at his leisure) fit forms of
swearing suitable to all cases, from the lowest to the highest
provocation which could possibly happen to him——which
forms being well considered by him, and such moreover as he could
stand to, he kept them ever by him on the chimney-piece, within his
reach, ready for use.—I never apprehended, replied Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, that such a thing was ever thought
of——much less executed. I beg your pardon, answered my
father; I was reading, though not using, one of them to my brother
<i>Toby</i> this morning, whilst he pour’d out the
tea—’tis here upon the shelf over my head;—but if I remember right,
’tis too violent for a cut of the thumb.—Not at all,
quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>—the devil take the
fellow.——Then, answered my father, ’Tis much at
your service, Dr. <i>Slop</i>—on condition you will read it
aloud;——so rising up and reaching down a form of
excommunication of the church of <i>Rome</i>, a copy of which, my
father (who was curious in his collections) had procured out of the
leger-book of the church of <i>Rochester</i>, writ by
E<small>RNULPHUS</small> the bishop——with a most
affected seriousness of look and voice, which might have cajoled
E<small>RNULPHUS</small> himself—he put it into Dr.
<i>Slop</i>’s hands.——Dr. <i>Slop</i> wrapt his
thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief, and with a wry face,
though without any suspicion, read aloud, as
follows——my uncle <i>Toby</i> whistling
<i>Lillabullero</i> as loud as he could all the time.</p>

As the geniuneness of the consultation of the Sorbonne upon the question of
baptism, was doubted by some, and denied by others——’twas
thought proper to print the original of this excommunication; for the copy of
which Mr. <i>Shandy</i> returns thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean and
chapter of <i>Rochester.</i>
</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IV</small>
</h3>

<p>“B<small>Y</small> the authority of God
Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and of the holy canons,
and of the undefiled Virgin <i>Mary</i>, mother and patroness of
our Saviour.” I think there is no necessity, quoth Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, dropping the paper down to his knee, and addressing
himself to my father——as you have read it over, Sir, so
lately, to read it aloud——and as Captain <i>Shandy</i>
seems to have no great inclination to hear it——I may as
well read it to myself. That’s contrary to treaty, replied my
father:——besides, there is something so whimsical,
especially in the latter part of it, I should grieve to lose the
pleasure of a second reading. Dr. <i>Slop</i> did not altogether
like it,——but my uncle <i>Toby</i> offering at that
instant to give over whistling, and read it himself to
them;——Dr. <i>Slop</i> thought he might as well read it
under the cover of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
whistling——as suffer my uncle <i>Toby</i> to read it
alone;——so raising up the paper to his face, and
holding it quite parallel to it, in order to hide his
chagrin——he read it aloud as follows——my
uncle <i>Toby</i> whistling <i>Lillabullero</i>, though not quite
so loud as before.</p>

<p>
“By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and
of the undefiled Virgin <i>Mary</i>, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and
of all the celestial virtues, angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, powers,
cherubins and seraphins, and of all the holy patriarchs, prophets, and of all
the apostles and evangelists, and of the holy innocents, who in the sight of
the Holy Lamb, are found worthy to sing the new song of the holy martyrs and
holy confessors, and of the holy virgins, and of all the saints together, with
the holy and elect of God,—May he” (<i>Obadiah</i>) “be
damn’d” (for tying these knots)——“We
excommunicate, and anathematize him, and from the thresholds of the holy
“church of God Almighty we sequester him, that he may be tormented,
disposed, and delivered over with <i>Dathan</i> and <i>Abiram</i>, and with
those who say unto the Lord God, Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways.
And as fire is quenched with water, so let the light of him be put out for
evermore, unless it shall repent him” (<i>Obadiah</i>, of the knots which
he has tied) “and make satisfaction” (for them) “Amen.”
</p>

<p>“May the Father who created man, curse
him.——May the Son who suffered for us curse
him.——May the Holy Ghost, who was given to us in
baptism, curse him”
(<i>Obadiah</i>)——“May the holy cross which
Christ, for our salvation triumphing over his enemies, ascended,
curse him.</p>

<p>“May the holy and eternal Virgin <i>Mary</i>, mother
of God, curse him.——May St. <i>Michael</i>, the
advocate of holy souls, curse him.——May all
the angels and archangels, principalities and powers, and all the
heavenly armies, curse him.” [Our armies swore terribly in
<i>Flanders</i>, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——but
nothing to this.——For my own part I could not have a
heart to curse my dog so.]</p>

<p>“May St. John, the Præcursor, and St. John the
Baptist, and St. Peter and St. Paul, and St. Andrew, and all other
Christ’s apostles, together curse him. And may the rest of
his disciples and four evangelists, who by their preaching
converted the universal world, and may the holy and wonderful
company of martyrs and confessors who by their holy works are found
pleasing to God Almighty, curse him’ (<i>Obadiah</i>.)</p>

<p>
“May the holy choir of the holy virgins, who for the honour of Christ
have despised the things of the world, damn him——May all the
saints, who from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages are found to be
beloved of God, damn him—
</p>

<p>“May the heavens and earth,
and all the holy things remaining therein, damn him,”
(<i>Obadiah</i>) “or her,” (or whoever else had a hand
in tying these knots.)</p>

<p>“May he (<i>Obadiah</i>) be damn’d wherever he
be——whether in the house or the stables, the garden or
the field, or the highway, or in the path, or in the wood, or in
the water, or in the church.——May he be cursed in
living, in dying.” [Here my uncle <i>Toby</i>, taking the
advantage of a <i>minim</i> in the second bar of his tune, kept
whistling one continued note to the end of the
sentence.——Dr. <i>Slop</i>, with his division of curses
moving under him, like a running bass all the way.]
“May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being
hungry, in being thirsty, in fasting, in sleeping, in slumbering,
in walking, in standing, in sitting, in lying, in working, in
resting, in pissing, in shitting, and in blood-letting!</p>

<p>“May he” (<i>Obadiah</i>)
“be cursed in all the faculties of his body!</p>

<p>“May he be cursed inwardly and
outwardly!——May he be cursed in the hair of his
head!——May he be cursed in his brains, and in his
vertex,” (that is a sad curse, quoth my father)
“in his temples, in his forehead, in his ears, in his
eye-brows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
fore-teeth and grinders, in his lips, in his throat, in his
shoulders, in his wrists, in his arms, in his hands, in his
fingers!</p>

<p>“May he be damn’d in his mouth, in his breast,
in his heart and purtenance, down to the very stomach!</p>

<p>“May he be cursed in his reins, and in his
groin,” (God in heaven forbid! quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>)
“in his thighs, in his genitals,” (my father
shook his head) “and in his hips, and in his knees, his legs,
and feet, and toe- nails!</p>

<p>“May he be cursed in all the joints and
articulations of the members, from the top of his head to the sole of his
foot! May there be no soundness in him!</p>

<p>“May the son of the living God, with all the glory
of his Majesty”——(Here my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
throwing back his head, gave a monstrous, long, loud
Whew—w—w———something betwixt the
interjectional whistle of <i>Hay-day!</i> and the word
itself.——</p>

<p>——By the golden beard of <i>Jupiter</i>—and of
<i>Juno</i> (if her majesty wore one) and by the beards of the rest
of your heathen worships, which by the bye was no small number,
since what with the beards of your celestial gods, and gods aerial
and aquatick—to say nothing of the beards of town-gods and
country-gods, or of the celestial goddesses your wives, or of the
infernal goddesses your whores and concubines (that is in case they
wore them)——all which beards, as <i>Varro</i> tells me,
upon his word and honour, when mustered up together, made no less
than thirty thousand effective beards upon the Pagan
establishment;——every beard of which claimed the rights and privileges of being
stroken and sworn by—by all these beards together
then——I vow and protest, that of the two bad cassocks I
am worth in the world, I would have given the better of them, as
freely as ever <i>Cid Hamet</i> offered his——to have
stood by, and heard my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s accompanyment.</p>

<p>——“curse him!”—continued Dr.
<i>Slop</i>,—“and may heaven, with all the powers which
move therein, rise up against him, curse and damn him”
(<i>Obadiah</i>) “unless he repent and make satisfaction!
Amen. So be it,—so be it. Amen.”</p>

<p>I declare, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, my heart would not let me
curse the devil himself with so much bitterness.—He is the
father of curses, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>.——So am not
I, replied my uncle.——But he is cursed, and
damn’d already, to all eternity, replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>.</p>

<p>I am sorry for it, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Slop</i> drew up his mouth, and wasjust beginning to return my uncle <i>Toby</i> the
compliment of his Whu—u—u—or interjectional
whistle——when the door hastily opening in the next
chapter but one——put an end to the affair.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;V</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> don’t let us give ourselves
a parcel of airs, and pretend that the oaths we make free with in
this land of liberty of ours are our own; and because we have the
spirit to swear them,——imagine that we have had the wit
to invent them too.</p>

<p>I’ll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the
world, except to a connoisseur:——though I declare I
object only to a connoisseur in swearing,——as I would
do to a connoisseur in painting, &amp;c. &amp;c. the whole set of
’em are so hung round and <i>befetish’d</i> with the
bobs and trinkets of criticism,——or to drop my
metaphor, which by the bye is a pity——for I have
fetch’d it as far as from the coast of
<i>Guiney</i>;—their heads, Sir, are stuck so full of rules and compasses, and
have that eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions, that
a work of genius had better go to the devil at once, than stand to
be prick’d and tortured to death by ’em.</p>

<p>—And how did <i>Garrick</i> speak the soliloquy last
night?—Oh, against all rule, my lord,—most
ungrammatically! betwixt the substantive and the adjective, which
should agree together in <i>number, case</i>, and <i>gender</i>, he
made a breach thus,—stopping, as if the point wanted
settling;—and betwixt the nominative case, which your
lordship knows should govern the verb, he suspended his voice in
the epilogue a dozen times three seconds and three fifths by a stop
watch, my lord, each time.—Admirable
grammarian!——But in suspending his
voice——was the sense suspended likewise? Did no
expression of attitude or countenance fill up the
chasm?——Was the eye silent? Did you narrowly
look?——I look’d only at the stop-watch, my
lord.—Excellent observer!</p>

<p>And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout
about?——Oh! ’tis out of all plumb, my
lord,——quite an irregular thing!—not one of the
angles at the four corners was a right angle.—I had my rule
and compasses, &amp;c. my lord, in my pocket.—Excellent
critick!</p>

<p>——And for the epick poem your lordship bid me look
at——upon taking the length, breadth, height, and depth
of it, and trying them at home upon an exact scale of
<i>Bossu</i>’s——’tis out, my lord, in every
one of its dimensions.—Admirable connoisseur!</p>

<p>——And did you step in, to take a look at the grand
picture in your way back?—’Tis a melancholy daub! my
lord; not one principle of the pyramid in any one
group!——and what a price!——for there is
nothing of the colouring of <i>Titian</i>—the expression of
<i>Rubens</i>—the grace of <i>Raphael</i>—the purity of
<i>Dominichino</i>—the <i>corregiescity</i> of
<i>Corregio</i>—the learning of <i>Poussin</i>—the airs
of <i>Guido</i>—the taste of the <i>Carrachis</i>—or the grand contour of <i>Angelo.</i>—Grant
me patience, just Heaven!—Of all the cants which are canted
in this canting world—though the cant of hypocrites may be
the worst——the cant of criticism is the most
tormenting!</p>

<p>I would go fifty miles on foot, for I have not a horse worth
riding on, to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will
give up the reins of his imagination into his author’s
hands——be pleased he knows not why, and cares not
wherefore.</p>

<p>Great <i>Apollo!</i> if thou art in a giving humour—give
me—I ask no more, but one stroke of native humour, with a
single spark of thy own fire along with it——and send
<i>Mercury</i>, with the <i>rules and compasses</i>, if he can be
spared, with my compliments to—no matter.</p>

<p>Now to any one else I will undertake to prove, that all the
oaths and imprecations which we have been puffing off upon the
world for these two hundred and fifty years last past as
originals——except <i>St. Paul’s
thumb</i>——<i>God’s flesh and God’s fish</i>, which were oaths
monarchical, and, considering who made them, not much amiss; and as
kings oaths, ’tis not much matter whether they were fish or
flesh;—else I say, there is not an oath, or at least a curse
amongst them, which has not been copied over and over again out of
<i>Ernulphus</i> a thousand times: but, like all other copies, how
infinitely short of the force and spirit of the original!—it
is thought to be no bad oath——and by itself passes very
well—“<i>G—d damn you.</i>”—Set it
beside <i>Ernulphus</i>’s——“God
almighty the Father damn you—God the Son damn you—God
the Holy Ghost damn you”—you see ’tis
nothing.—There is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up
to: besides, he is more copious in his
invention—possess’d more of the excellencies of a
swearer——had such a thorough knowledge of the human
frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knittings of the joints,
and articulations,—that when <i>Ernulphus</i> cursed—no
part escaped him.—’Tis true there is something of a
<i>hardness</i> in his manner——and, as in <i>Michael
Angelo</i>, a want of grace——but then there is such a
greatness of <i>gusto!</i></p>

<p>My father, who generally look’d upon every thing in a
light very different from all mankind, would, after all, never
allow this to be an original.——He considered rather
<i>Ernulphus</i>’s anathema, as an institute of swearing, in
which, as he suspected, upon the decline of <i>swearing</i> in some
milder pontificate, <i>Ernulphus</i>, by order of the succeeding
pope, had with great learning and diligence collected together all
the laws of it;—for the same reason that <i>Justinian</i>, in
the decline of the empire, had ordered his chancellor
<i>Tribonian</i> to collect the <i>Roman</i> or civil laws all
together into one code or digest——lest, through the
rust of time——and the fatality of all things committed
to oral tradition—they should be lost to the world for
ever.</p>

<p>For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not
an oath from the great and tremendous oath of <i>William</i> the
conqueror (<i>By the splendour of God</i>) down to the lowest oath of a
scavenger (<i>Damn your eyes</i>) which was not to be found in
<i>Ernulphus.</i>—In short, he would add—I defy a man
to swear <i>out</i> of it.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is, like most of my father’s, singular and
ingenious too;——nor have I any objection to it, but
that it overturns my own.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VI</small>
</h3>

<p>——B<small>LESS</small> my soul!—my
poor mistress is ready to faint——and her pains are
gone—and the drops are done—and the bottle of julap is
broke——and the nurse has cut her arm—(and I, my
thumb, cried Dr. <i>Slop</i>,) and the child is where it was,
continued <i>Susannah</i>,—and the midwife has fallen
backwards upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip as black
as your hat.—I’ll look at it, quoth Dr
<i>Slop</i>.—There is no need of that, replied
<i>Susannah</i>,—you had better look at my mistress—but
the midwife would gladly first give you an account how things are, so
desires you would go up stairs and speak to her this moment.</p>

<p>Human nature is the same in all professions.</p>

<p>The midwife had just before been put over Dr.
<i>Slop</i>’s head—He had not digested it.—No,
replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, ’twould be full as proper if the
midwife came down to me.—I like subordination, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—and but for it, after the reduction of
<i>Lisle</i>, I know not what might have become of the garrison of
<i>Ghent</i>, in the mutiny for bread, in the year Ten.—Nor,
replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, (parodying my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
hobby-horsical reflection; though full as hobby-horsical
himself)——do I know, Captain <i>Shandy</i>, what might
have become of the garrison above stairs, in the mutiny and
confusion I find all things are in at present, but for the
subordination of fingers and thumbs to ******——the
application of which, Sir, under this accident of mine, comes in so
<i>à propos</i>, that without it, the cut upon my thumb
might have been felt by the <i>Shandy</i> family, as long as the
<i>Shandy</i> family had a name.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VII</small>
</h3>

<p>L<small>ET</small> us go back to the
******——in the last chapter.</p>

<p>It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at least it was so, when
eloquence flourished at <i>Athens</i> and <i>Rome</i>, and would be
so now, did orators wear mantles) not to mention the name of a
thing, when you had the thing about you <i>in petto</i>, ready to
produce, pop, in the place you want it. A scar, an axe, a sword, a
pink’d doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a half of
pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-halfpenny pickle pot—but
above all, a tender infant royally accoutred.—Tho’ if
it was too young, and the oration as long as <i>Tully</i>’s
second <i>Philippick</i>—it must certainly have beshit the
orator’s mantle.—And then again, if too old,—it
must have been unwieldly and incommodious to his action—so as
to make him lose by his child almost as much as he could gain by it.—Otherwise, when a state
orator has hit the precise age to a minute——hid his
BAMBINO in his mantle so cunningly that no mortal could smell
it——and produced it so critically, that no soul could
say, it came in by head and shoulders—Oh Sirs! it has done
wonders—It has open’d the sluices, and turn’d the
brains, and shook the principles, and unhinged the politicks of
half a nation.</p>

<p>These feats however are not to be done, except in those states
and times, I say, where orators wore mantles——and
pretty large ones too, my brethren, with some twenty or
five-and-twenty yards of good purple, superfine, marketable cloth
in them—with large flowing folds and doubles, and in a great
style of design.—All which plainly shews, may it please your
worships, that the decay of eloquence, and the little good service
it does at present, both within and without doors, is owing to
nothing else in the world, but short coats, and the disuse of <i>trunk-hose.</i>—We can conceal nothing
under ours, Madam, worth shewing.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VIII</small>
</h3>

<p>D<small>R</small>. <i>Slop</i> was within an ace of
being an exception to all this argumentation: for happening to have
his green baize bag upon his knees, when he began to parody my
uncle <i>Toby</i>—’twas as good as the best mantle in
the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence
would end in his new-invented forceps, he thrust his hand into the
bag in order to have them ready to clap in, when your reverences
took so much notice of the ***, which had he
managed——my uncle <i>Toby</i> had certainly been
overthrown: the sentence and the argument in that case jumping
closely in one point, so like the two lines which form the salient
angle of a ravelin,——Dr. <i>Slop</i> would never have
given them up;—and my uncle <i>Toby</i> would as soon have
thought of flying, as taking them by force: but Dr. <i>Slop</i> fumbled so vilely in
pulling them out, it took off the whole effect, and what was a ten
times worse evil (for they seldom come alone in this life) in
pulling out his <i>forceps</i>, his <i>forceps</i> unfortunately
drew out the <i>squirt</i> along with it.</p>

<p>When a proposition can be taken in two senses—’tis a
law in disputation, That the respondent may reply to which of the
two he pleases, or finds most convenient for him.——This
threw the advantage of the argument quite on my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s side.—“Good God!”
cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, “<i>are children brought into the
world with a squirt?</i>”</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IX</small>
</h3>

<p>—U<small>PON</small> my honour, Sir, you have
tore every bit of skin quite off the back of both my hands with
your forceps, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>—and you have
crush’d all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a
jelly. ’Tis your own fault, said Dr.
<i>Slop</i>——you should have clinch’d your two fists together into the
form of a child’s head as I told you, and sat firm.—I
did so, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——Then the points
of my forceps have not been sufficiently arm’d, or the rivet
wants closing—or else the cut on my thumb has made me a
little aukward—or possibly—’Tis well, quoth my
father, interrupting the detail of possibilities—that the
experiment was not first made upon my child’s
head-piece.——It would not have been a cherry-stone the
worse, answered Dr. <i>Slop</i>.—I maintain it, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, it would have broke the cerebellum (unless indeed the
skull had been as hard as a granado) and turn’d it all into a
perfect posset.——Pshaw! replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, a
child’s head is naturally as soft as the pap of an
apple;—the sutures give way—and besides, I could have
extracted by the feet after.—Not you, said
she.——I rather wish you would begin that way, quoth my
father.</p>

<p>Pray do, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;X</small>
</h3>

<p>——A<small>ND</small> pray, good woman,
after all, will you take upon you to say, it may not be the
child’s hip, as well as the child’s
head?——’Tis most certainly the head, replied the
midwife. Because, continued Dr. <i>Slop</i> (turning to my father)
as positive as these old ladies generally are—’tis a
point very difficult to know—and yet of the greatest
consequence to be known;——because, Sir, if the hip is
mistaken for the head—there is a possibility (if it is a boy)
that the forceps * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>——What the possibility was, Dr. <i>Slop</i>
whispered very low to my father, and then to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.——There is no such danger, continued he,
with the head.—No, in truth quoth my father—but when
your possibility has taken place at the hip—you may as well
take off the head too.</p>

<p>——It is morally impossible the reader should understand this——’tis
enough Dr. <i>Slop</i> understood it;——so taking the
green baize bag in his hand, with the help of
<i>Obadiah</i>’s pumps, he tripp’d pretty nimbly, for a
man of his size, across the room to the door——and from
the door was shewn the way, by the good old midwife, to my
mother’s apartments.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XI</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is two hours, and ten
minutes—and no more—cried my father, looking at his
watch, since Dr. <i>Slop</i> and <i>Obadiah</i> arrived—and I
know not how it happens, Brother <i>Toby</i>—but to my
imagination it seems almost an age.</p>

<p>——Here—pray, Sir, take hold of my
cap—nay, take the bell along with it, and my pantoufles
too.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, they are all at your service; and I freely make you a
present of ’em, on condition you give me all your attention
to this chapter.</p>

<p>Though my father said, “<i>he knew not how it happen’d</i>,”—yet he
knew very well how it happen’d;——and at the
instant he spoke it, was pre-determined in his mind to give my
uncle <i>Toby</i> a clear account of the matter by a metaphysical
dissertation upon the subject of <i>duration and its simple
modes</i>, in order to shew my uncle <i>Toby</i> by what mechanism
and mensurations in the brain it came to pass, that the rapid
succession of their ideas, and the eternal scampering of the
discourse from one thing to another, since Dr. <i>Slop</i> had come
into the room, had lengthened out so short a period to so
inconceivable an extent.——“I know not how
it happens—cried my father,—but it seems an
age.”</p>

<p>——’Tis owing entirely, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, to the succession of our ideas.</p>

<p>My father, who had an itch, in common with all philosophers, of
reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it
too—proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the
succession of ideas, and had not the least apprehension of having
it snatch’d out of his hands by my uncle <i>Toby</i>, who (honest man!)
generally took every thing as it happened;——and who, of
all things in the world, troubled his brain the least with abstruse
thinking;—the ideas of time and space—or how we came by
those ideas—or of what stuff they were made——or
whether they were born with us—or we picked them up
afterwards as we went along—or whether we did it in
frocks——or not till we had got into breeches—with
a thousand other inquiries and disputes about <small>INFINITY
PRESCIENCE, LIBERTY, NECESSITY,</small> and so forth, upon whose
desperate and unconquerable theories so many fine heads have been
turned and cracked——never did my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s the least injury at all; my father knew
it—and was no less surprized than he was disappointed, with
my uncle’s fortuitous solution.</p>

<p>Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my
father.</p>

<p>Not I, quoth my uncle.</p>

<p>—But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk
about?</p>

<p>No more than my horse, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping
his two hands together——there is a worth in thy honest
ignorance, brother <i>Toby</i>——’twere almost a
pity to exchange it for a knowledge.—But I’ll tell
thee.——</p>

<p>
To understand what time is aright, without which we never can comprehend
<i>infinity</i>, insomuch as one is a portion of the other——we
ought seriously to sit down and consider what idea it is we have of
<i>duration</i>, so as to give a satisfactory account how we came by
it.——What is that to any body? quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.<a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
<i>For if you will turn your eyes inwards upon your mind</i>, continued my
father, <i>and observe attentively, you will perceive, brother, that whilst you
and I are talking together, and thinking, and smoking our pipes, or whilst we
receive successively ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist, and so we
estimate the existence, or the continuation of the existence of ourselves, or
any thing else, commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the
duration of ourselves, or any such other thing co-existing with our
thinking——and so according to that
preconceived</i>——You puzzle me to death, cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.
</p>

<p>——’Tis owing to this, replied my father, that
in our computations of time, we are so used to minutes, hours,
weeks, and months——and of clocks (I wish there was not
a clock in the kingdom) to measure out their several portions to
us, and to those who belong to us——that ’twill be
well, if in time to come, the <i>succession of our ideas</i> be of
any use or service to us at all.</p>

<p>Now, whether we observe it or no, continued my father, in every
sound man’s head, there is a regular succession of ideas of
one sort or other, which follow each other in train just
like——A train of artillery? said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——A train of a fiddle-stick!—quoth my
father—which follow and succeed one another in our minds at certain distances, just
like the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the
heat of a candle.—I declare, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, mine
are more like a smoke-jack.——Then, brother <i>Toby</i>,
I have nothing more to say to you upon that subject, said my
father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XII</small>
</h3>

<p>——W<small>HAT</small> a conjuncture was
here lost!——My father in one of his best explanatory
moods—in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into the very
regions, where clouds and thick darkness would soon have
encompassed it about;—my uncle <i>Toby</i> in one of the
finest dispositions for it in the world;—his head like a
smoke-jack;——the funnel unswept, and the ideas whirling
round and round about in it, all obfuscated and darkened over with
fuliginous matter!—By the tomb-stone of
<i>Lucian</i>——if it is in being——if not,
why then by his ashes! by the ashes of my dear <i>Rabelais</i>, and dearer <i>Cervantes!</i>——my
father and my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s discourse upon
<small>TIME</small> and <small>ETERNITY</small>——was a
discourse devoutly to be wished for! and the petulancy of my
father’s humour, in putting a stop to it as he did, was a
robbery of the <i>Ontologic Treasury</i> of such a jewel, as no
coalition of great occasions and great men are ever likely to
restore to it again.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HO</small>’ my father persisted in not
going on with the discourse—yet he could not get my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s smoke-jack out of his head—piqued as he
was at first with it;—there was something in the comparison
at the bottom, which hit his fancy; for which purpose, resting his
elbow upon the table, and reclining the right side of his head upon
the palm of his hand——but looking first stedfastly in
the fire——he began to commune with himself, and
philosophize about it: but his spirits being wore out with the
fatigues of investigating new tracts, and the constant exertion of his faculties upon that
variety of subjects which had taken their turn in the
discourse——the idea of the smoke jack soon turned all
his ideas upside down—so that he fell asleep almost before he
knew what he was about.</p>

<p>As for my uncle <i>Toby</i>, his smoke-jack had not made a dozen
revolutions, before he fell asleep also.——Peace be with
them both!——Dr. <i>Slop</i> is engaged with the midwife
and my mother above stairs.——<i>Trim</i> is busy in
turning an old pair of jack-boots into a couple of mortars, to be
employed in the siege of <i>Messina</i> next summer—and is
this instant boring the touch-holes with the point of a hot
poker.——All my heroes are off my
hands;—’tis the first time I have had a moment to
spare—and I’ll make use of it, and write my
preface.</p>

<p class="center">
The&nbsp;
&nbsp;<small>A&nbsp;U&nbsp;T&nbsp;H&nbsp;O&nbsp;R&nbsp;</small>’s&nbsp;
&nbsp;<small>P&nbsp;R&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;A&nbsp;C&nbsp;E</small>
</p>

<p>N<small>O</small>, I’ll not say a word about
it——here it is;—in publishing it—I have
appealed to the world——and to the world I leave
it;—it must speak for itself.</p>

<p>All I know of the matter is—when I sat down, my intent was
to write a good book; and as far as the tenuity of my understanding
would hold out—a wise, aye, and a discreet—taking care
only, as I went along, to put into it all the wit and the judgment
(be it more or less) which the great Author and Bestower of them
had thought fit originally to give me——so that, as your
worships see—’tis just as God pleases.</p>

<p>Now, <i>Agalastes</i> (speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, That
there may be some wit in it, for aught he knows——but no
judgment at all. And <i>Triptolemus</i> and <i>Phutatorius</i>
agreeing thereto, ask, How is it possible there should? for that
wit and judgment in this world never go together; inasmuch as they are two operations differing
from each other as wide as east from west——So, says
<i>Locke</i>——so are farting and hickuping, say I. But
in answer to this, <i>Didius</i> the great church lawyer, in his
code <i>de fartendi et illustrandi fallaciis</i>, doth maintain and
make fully appear, That an illustration is no
argument——nor do I maintain the wiping of a
looking-glass clean to be a syllogism;—but you all, may it
please your worships, see the better for it——so that
the main good these things do is only to clarify the understanding,
previous to the application of the argument itself, in order to
free it from any little motes, or specks of opacular matter, which,
if left swimming therein, might hinder a conception and spoil
all.</p>

<p>Now, my dear anti-Shandeans, and thrice able criticks, and
fellow-labourers (for to you I write this Preface)——and
to you, most subtle statesmen and discreet doctors (do—pull
off your beards) renowned for gravity and
wisdom;——<i>Monopolus</i>, my
politician—<i>Didius</i>, my counsel; <i>Kysarcius</i>, my
friend;—<i>Phutatorius</i>, my
guide;——<i>Gastripheres</i>, the preserver of my life;
<i>Somnolentius</i>, the balm and repose of it——not
forgetting all others, as well sleeping as waking, ecclesiastical
as civil, whom for brevity, but out of no resentment to you, I lump
all together.——Believe me, right worthy,</p>

<p>My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf, and in
my own too, in case the thing is not done already for
us——is, that the great gifts and endowments both of wit
and judgment, with every thing which usually goes along with
them——such as memory, fancy, genius, eloquence, quick
parts, and what not, may this precious moment, without stint or
measure, let or hindrance, be poured down warm as each of us could
bear it—scum and sediment and all (for I would not have a
drop lost) into the several receptacles, cells, cellules,
domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and spare places of our
brains——in such sort, that they might continue to be
injected and tunn’d into, according to the true intent
and meaning of my wish, until every vessel of them, both great and
small, be so replenish’d, saturated, and filled up therewith,
that no more, would it save a man’s life, could possibly be
got either in or out.</p>

<p>Bless us!—what noble work we should make!——how
should I tickle it off!——and what spirits should I find
myself in, to be writing away for such readers!——and
you—just heaven!——with what raptures would you
sit and read—but oh!—’tis too much——I
am sick——I faint away deliciously at the thoughts of
it—’tis more than nature can bear!—lay hold of
me——I am giddy—I am stone blind—I’m
dying—I am gone.—Help! Help! Help!—But
hold—I grow something better again, for I am beginning to
foresee, when this is over, that as we shall all of us continue to
be great wits—we should never agree amongst ourselves, one
day to an end:——there would be so much satire and
sarcasm——scoffing and flouting, with raillying and reparteeing of it—thrusting
and parrying in one corner or another——there would be
nothing but mischief among us——Chaste stars! what
biting and scratching, and what a racket and a clatter we should
make, what with breaking of heads, rapping of knuckles, and hitting
of sore places—there would be no such thing as living for
us.</p>

<p>But then again, as we should all of us be men of great judgment,
we should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong; and
though we should abominate each other ten times worse than so many
devils or devilesses, we should nevertheless, my dear creatures, be
all courtesy and kindness, milk and honey—’twould be a
second land of promise—a paradise upon earth, if there was
such a thing to be had—so that upon the whole we should have
done well enough.</p>

<p>All I fret and fume at, and what most distresses my invention at
present, is how to bring the point itself to bear; for as your
worships well know, that of these heavenly emanations of <i>wit</i> and
<i>judgment</i>, which I have so bountifully wished both for your
worships and myself—there is but a certain <i>quantum</i>
stored up for us all, for the use and behoof of the whole race of
mankind; and such small modicums of ’em are only sent forth
into this wide world, circulating here and there in one bye corner
or another—and in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious
intervals from each other, that one would wonder how it holds out,
or could be sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many
great estates, and populous empires.</p>

<p>Indeed there is one thing to be considered, that in <i>Nova
Zembla, North Lapland</i>, and in all those cold and dreary tracks
of the globe, which lie more directly under the arctick and
antartick circles, where the whole province of a man’s
concernments lies for near nine months together within the narrow
compass of his cave—where the spirits are compressed almost
to nothing—and where the passions of a man, with every thing
which belongs to them, are as frigid as the zone
itself—there the least quantity of <i>judgment</i> imaginable
does the business——and of <i>wit</i>——there
is a total and an absolute saving—for as not one spark is
wanted—so not one spark is given. Angels and ministers of
grace defend us! what a dismal thing would it have been to have
governed a kingdom, to have fought a battle, or made a treaty, or
run a match, or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a provincial
chapter there, with so <i>plentiful a lack</i> of wit and judgment
about us! For mercy’s sake, let us think no more about it,
but travel on as fast as we can southwards into
<i>Norway</i>—crossing over <i>Swedeland</i>, if you please,
through the small triangular province of <i>Angermania</i> to the
lake of <i>Bothmia</i>; coasting along it through east and west
<i>Bothnia</i>, down to <i>Carelia</i>, and so on, through all
those states and provinces which border upon the far side of the
<i>Gulf</i> of <i>Finland</i>, and the north-east of the
<i>Baltick</i>, up to <i>Petersbourg</i>, and just stepping into
<i>Ingria</i>;—then stretching over directly from thence through the north parts of the
<i>Russian</i> empire—leaving <i>Siberia</i> a little upon
the left hand, till we got into the very heart of <i>Russian</i>
and <i>Asiatick Tartary.</i></p>

<p>Now through this long tour which I have led you, you observe the
good people are better off by far, than in the polar countries
which we have just left:—for if you hold your hand over your
eyes, and look very attentively, you may perceive some small
glimmerings (as it were) of wit, with a comfortable provision of
good plain houshold judgment, which, taking the quality and
quantity of it together, they make a very good shift
with——and had they more of either the one or the other,
it would destroy the proper balance betwixt them, and I am
satisfied moreover they would want occasions to put them to
use.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more
luxuriant island, where you perceive the spring-tide of our blood
and humours runs high——where we have more ambition, and
pride, and envy, and lechery, and other whoreson passions upon our
hands to govern and subject to reason——the
<i>height</i> of our wit, and the <i>depth</i> of our judgment, you
see, are exactly proportioned to the <i>length</i> and
<i>breadth</i> of our necessities——and accordingly we
have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and
creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to
complain.</p>

<p>It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air
blows hot and cold—wet and dry, ten times in a day, we have
them in no regular and settled way;—so that sometimes for
near half a century together, there shall be very little wit or
judgment either to be seen or heard of amongst us:——the
small channels of them shall seem quite dried up——then
all of a sudden the sluices shall break out, and take a fit of
running again like fury——you would think they would
never stop:——and then it is, that in writing, and fighting, and twenty other
gallant things, we drive all the world before us.</p>

<p>It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in
that kind of argumentative process, which <i>Suidas</i> calls
<i>dialectick induction</i>——that I draw and set up
this position as most true and veritable;</p>

<p>That of these two luminaries so much of their irradiations are
suffered from time to time to shine down upon us, as he, whose
infinite wisdom which dispenses every thing in exact weight and
measure, knows will just serve to light us on our way in this night
of our obscurity; so that your reverences and worships now find
out, nor is it a moment longer in my power to conceal it from you,
That the fervent wish in your behalf with which I set out, was no
more than the first insinuating <i>How d’ye</i> of a
caressing prefacer, stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes does
a coy mistress, into silence. For alas! could this effusion of
light have been as easily procured, as the exordium wished it—I tremble to think how many
thousands for it, of benighted travellers (in the learned sciences
at least) must have groped and blundered on in the dark, all the
nights of their lives——running their heads against
posts, and knocking out their brains without ever getting to their
journies end;——some falling with their noses
perpendicularly into sinks——others horizontally with
their tails into kennels. Here one half of a learned profession
tilting full but against the other half of it, and then tumbling
and rolling one over the other in the dirt like hogs.—Here
the brethren of another profession, who should have run in
opposition to each other, flying on the contrary like a flock of
wild geese, all in a row the same way.—What
confusion!—what mistakes!——fiddlers and painters
judging by their eyes and ears—admirable!—trusting to
the passions excited—in an air sung, or a story painted to
the heart——instead of measuring them by a quadrant.</p>

<p>In the fore-ground of this picture, a <i>statesman</i> turning the political wheel, like a
brute, the wrong way round——<i>against</i> the stream
of corruption—by Heaven!——instead of <i>with</i>
it.</p>

<p>In this corner, a son of the divine <i>Esculapius</i>, writing a
book against predestination; perhaps worse—feeling his
patient’s pulse, instead of his
apothecary’s——a brother of the Faculty in the
back-ground upon his knees in tears—drawing the curtains of a
mangled victim to beg his forgiveness;—offering a
fee—instead of taking one.</p>

<p>
In that spacious <small>HALL</small>, a coalition of the gown, from all the
bars of it, driving a damn’d, dirty, vexatious cause before them, with
all their might and main, the wrong way!——kicking it <i>out</i> of
the great doors, instead of, <i>in</i>——and with such fury in their
looks, and such a degree of inveteracy in their manner of kicking it, as if the
laws had been originally made for the peace and preservation of
mankind:——perhaps a more enormous mistake committed by them
still——a litigated point fairly hung up;——for instance,
Whether <i>John o’Nokes</i> his nose could stand in <i>Tom
o’Stiles</i> his face, without a trespass, or not—rashly determined
by them in five-and-twenty minutes, which, with the cautious pros and cons
required in so intricate a proceeding, might have taken up as many
months——and if carried on upon a military plan, as your honours
know an <small>ACTION</small> should be, with all the stratagems practicable
therein,——such as feints,—forced
marches,—surprizes—ambuscades—mask-batteries, and a thousand
other strokes of generalship, which consist in catching at all advantages on
both sides——might reasonably have lasted them as many years,
finding food and raiment all that term for a centumvirate of the profession.
</p>

<p>As for the Clergy——No——if I say a word
against them, I’ll be shot.——I have no desire;
and besides, if I had—I durst not for my soul touch upon the
subject——with such weak nerves and spirits, and in the
condition I am in at present, ’twould be as much as my
life was worth, to deject and contrist myself with so bad and
melancholy an account—and therefore ’tis safer to draw
a curtain across, and hasten from it, as fast as I can, to the main
and principal point I have undertaken to clear up——and
that is, How it comes to pass, that your men of least <i>wit</i>
are reported to be men of most <i>judgment.</i>——But
mark—I say, <i>reported to be</i>—for it is no more, my
dear Sirs, than a report, and which, like twenty others taken up
every day upon trust, I maintain to be a vile and a malicious
report into the bargain.</p>

<p>This by the help of the observation already premised, and I hope
already weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships, I
shall forthwith make appear.</p>

<p>I hate set dissertations——and above all things in
the world, ’tis one of the silliest things in one of them, to
darken your hypothesis by placing a number of tall, opake words,
one before another, in a right line, betwixt your own and your
reader’s conception—when in all likelihood, if you had
looked about, you might have seen something standing, or hanging
up, which would have cleared the point at
once—“for what hindrance, hurt, or harm doth the
laudable desire of knowledge bring to any man, if even from a sot,
a pot, a fool, a stool, a winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully,
the lid of a goldsmith’s crucible, an oil bottle, an old
slipper, or a cane chair?”—I am this moment
sitting upon one. Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair
of wit and judgment, by the two knobs on the top of the back of
it?—they are fastened on, you see, with two pegs stuck
slightly into two gimlet-holes, and will place what I have to say
in so clear a light, as to let you see through the drift and
meaning of my whole preface, as plainly as if every point and
particle of it was made up of sun-beams.</p>

<p>I enter now directly upon the point.</p>

<p>—Here stands <i>wit</i>—and there stands <i>judgment</i>, close beside it, just like the two
knobs I’m speaking of, upon the back of this self-same chair
on which I am sitting.</p>

<p>—You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts
of its <i>frame</i>—as wit and judgment are of
<i>ours</i>—and like them too, indubitably both made and
fitted to go together, in order, as we say in all such cases of
duplicated embellishments——<i>to answer one
another.</i></p>

<p>Now for the sake of an experiment, and for the clearer
illustrating this matter—let us for a moment take off one of
these two curious ornaments (I care not which) from the point or
pinnacle of the chair it now stands on—nay, don’t laugh
at it,—but did you ever see, in the whole course of your
lives, such a ridiculous business as this has made of
it?—Why, ’tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one
ear; and there is just as much sense and symmetry in the one as in
the other:——do——pray, get off your seats
only to take a view of it,——Now would any man who
valued his character a straw, have turned a piece of work out of
his hand in such a condition?——nay, lay your hands upon
your hearts, and answer this plain question, Whether this one
single knob, which now stands here like a blockhead by itself, can
serve any purpose upon earth, but to put one in mind of the want of
the other?—and let me farther ask, in case the chair was your
own, if you would not in your consciences think, rather than be as
it is, that it would be ten times better without any knob at
all?</p>

<p>Now these two knobs——or top ornaments of the mind of
man, which crown the whole entablature——being, as I
said, wit and judgment, which of all others, as I have proved it,
are the most needful——the most priz’d—the
most calamitous to be without, and consequently the hardest to come
at—for all these reasons put together, there is not a mortal
among us, so destitute of a love of good fame or
feeding——or so ignorant of what will do him good
therein—who does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his own
mind, to be, or to be thought at least, master of the one or the
other, and indeed of both of them, if the thing seems any way
feasible, or likely to be brought to pass.</p>

<p>Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in
aiming at the one—unless they laid hold of the
other,——pray what do you think would become of
them?——Why, Sirs, in spite of all their
<i>gravities</i>, they must e’en have been contented to have
gone with their insides naked——this was not to be
borne, but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the
case we are upon——so that no one could well have been
angry with them, had they been satisfied with what little they
could have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great
perriwigs, had they not raised a <i>hue</i> and <i>cry</i> at the
same time against the lawful owners.</p>

<p>I need not tell your worships, that this was done with so much
cunning and artifice——that the great <i>Locke</i>,
who was seldom outwitted by false
sounds——was nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it
seems, was so deep and solemn a one, and what with the help of
great wigs, grave faces, and other implements of deceit, was
rendered so general a one against the <i>poor wits</i> in this
matter, that the philosopher himself was deceived by it—it
was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand
vulgar errors;——but this was not of the number; so that
instead of sitting down coolly, as such a philosopher should have
done, to have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised
upon it—on the contrary he took the fact for granted, and so
joined in with the cry, and halloo’d it as boisterously as
the rest.</p>

<p>This has been made the <i>Magna Charta</i> of stupidity ever
since——but your reverences plainly see, it has been
obtained in such a manner, that the title to it is not worth a
groat:——which by-the-bye is one of the many and vile
impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for
hereafter.</p>

<p>As for great wigs, upon which I may be thought to have spoken my
mind too freely——I beg leave to qualify whatever has
been unguardedly said to their dispraise or prejudice, by one
general declaration —That I have no abhorrence whatever,
nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or long beards, any
farther than when I see they are bespoke and let grow on purpose to
carry on this self-same imposture—for any
purpose——peace be with them!— =&gt;mark
only——I write not for them.</p>

<p>E<small>VERY</small> day for at least ten years
together did my father resolve to have it mended—’tis
not mended yet;—no family but ours would have borne with it
an hour——and what is most astonishing, there was not a
subject in the world upon which my father was so eloquent, as upon
that of door-hinges.——And yet at the same time, he was
certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them, I think, that history can produce: his rhetorick and
conduct were at perpetual handy-cuffs.—Never did the
parlour-door open—but his philosophy or his principles fell a
victim to it;——three drops of oil with a feather, and a
smart stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour for ever.</p>

<p>——Inconsistent soul that man
is!——languishing under wounds, which he has the power
to heal!—his whole life a contradiction to his
knowledge!—his reason, that precious gift of God to
him—(instead of pouring in oil) serving but to sharpen his
sensibilities—to multiply his pains, and render him more
melancholy and uneasy under them!—Poor unhappy creature, that
he should do so!——Are not the necessary causes of
misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his
stock of sorrow;—struggle against evils which cannot be
avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of the trouble
they create him would remove from his heart for ever?</p>

<p>By all that is good and virtuous, if there are three drops of
oil to be got, and a hammer to be found within ten miles of
<i>Shandy Hall</i>——the parlour door hinge shall be
mended this reign.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> Corporal <i>Trim</i> had brought
his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work above
measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to
see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying
them directly into his parlour.</p>

<p>Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the
affair of <i>hinges</i>, I had a speculative consideration arising
out of it, and it is this.</p>

<p>Had the parlour door opened and turn’d upon its hinges, as
a door should do—</p>

<p>Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning
upon its hinges——(that is, in case things have all along gone well with your
worship,—otherwise I give up my simile)—in this case, I
say, there had been no danger either to master or man, in corporal
<i>Trim</i>’s peeping in: the moment he had beheld my father
and my uncle <i>Toby</i> fast asleep—the respectfulness of
his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent as death,
and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy as he had
found them: but the thing was, morally speaking, so very
impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was
suffered to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my
father submitted to upon its account—this was one; that he
never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner, but the
thoughts of being unavoidably awakened by the first person who
should open the door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and
so incessantly stepp’d in betwixt him and the first balmy
presage of his repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the
whole sweets of it.</p>

<p>“<i>When things move upon bad hinges</i>, an’ please your lordships, <i>how can
it be otherwise?”</i></p>

<p>Pray what’s the matter? Who is there? cried my father,
waking, the moment the door began to creak.——I wish the
smith would give a peep at that confounded
hinge.——’Tis nothing, an please your honour, said
<i>Trim</i>, but two mortars I am bringing in.—They
shan’t make a clatter with them here, cried my father
hastily.—If Dr. <i>Slop</i> has any drugs to pound, let him
do it in the kitchen.—May it please your honour, cried
<i>Trim</i>, they are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer,
which I have been making out of a pair of jack-boots, which
<i>Obadiah</i> told me your honour had left off wearing.—By
Heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair, as he
swore——I have not one appointment belonging to me,
which I set so much store by as I do by these
jack-boots——they were our great grandfather’s
brother <i>Toby</i>—they were <i>hereditary.</i> Then I fear,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby, Trim</i> has cut off the entail.—I
have only cut off the tops, an’ please your honour, cried
<i>Trim</i>——I hate perpetuities as much as any man
alive, cried my father——but these jack-boots, continued
he (smiling, though very angry at the same time) have been in the
family, brother, ever since the civil wars;——Sir
<i>Roger Shandy</i> wore them at the battle of
<i>Marston-Moor.</i>—I declare I would not have taken ten
pounds for them.——I’ll pay you the money, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking at the two
mortars with infinite pleasure, and putting his hand into his
breeches pocket as he viewed them——I’ll pay you
the ten pounds this moment with all my heart and
soul.——</p>

<p>Brother <i>Toby</i>, replied my father, altering his tone, you
care not what money you dissipate and throw away, provided,
continued he, ’tis but upon a
<small>SIEGE</small>.——Have I not one hundred and
twenty pounds a year, besides my half pay? cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.—What is that—replied my father
hastily—to ten pounds for a pair of jack-boots?—twelve
guineas for your <i>pontoons</i>?—half as much for your <i>Dutch</i> draw-bridge?—to say nothing of
the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last week, with
twenty other preparations for the siege of <i>Messina</i>: believe
me, dear brother <i>Toby</i>, continued my father, taking him
kindly by the hand—these military operations of yours are
above your strength;—you mean well brother——but
they carry you into greater expences than you were first aware
of;—and take my word, dear <i>Toby</i>, they will in the end
quite ruin your fortune, and make a beggar of you.—What
signifies it if they do, brother, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, so
long as we know ’tis for the good of the
nation?——</p>

<p>My father could not help smiling for his soul—his anger at
the worst was never more than a spark;—and the zeal and
simplicity of <i>Trim</i>—and the generous (though
hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle <i>Toby</i>, brought him into
perfect good humour with them in an instant.</p>

<p>Generous souls!—God prosper you both, and your mortar-pieces too! quoth my father to
himself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>LL</small> is quiet and hush, cried my
father, at least above stairs—I hear not one foot
stirring.—Prithee <i>Trim</i>, who’s in the kitchen?
There is no one soul in the kitchen, answered <i>Trim</i>, making a
low bow as he spoke, except Dr. <i>Slop</i>.—Confusion! cried
my father (getting upon his legs a second time)—not one
single thing has gone right this day! had I faith in astrology,
brother, (which, by the bye, my father had) I would have sworn some
retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of mine,
and turning every individual thing in it out of its
place.——Why, I thought Dr. <i>Slop</i> had been above
stairs with my wife, and so said you.——What can the
fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen!—He is busy,
an’ please your honour, replied <i>Trim</i>, in making a
bridge.——’Tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>:——pray, give my humble
service to Dr. <i>Slop, Trim</i>, and tell him I thank him
heartily.</p>

<p>You must know, my uncle <i>Toby</i> mistook the bridge—as
widely as my father mistook the mortars:——but to
understand how my uncle <i>Toby</i> could mistake the
bridge—I fear I must give you an exact account of the road
which led to it;—or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing
more dishonest in an historian than the use of one)——in
order to conceive the probability of this error in my uncle
<i>Toby</i> aright, I must give you some account of an adventure of
<i>Trim</i>’s, though much against my will, I say much
against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly
out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either
amongst the anecdotes of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s amours with
widow <i>Wadman</i>, in which corporal <i>Trim</i> was no mean
actor—or else in the middle of his and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s campaigns on the bowling-green—for it
will do very well in either place;—but then if I reserve it
for either of those parts of my story——I ruin
the story I’m upon;——and if I tell it
here——I anticipate matters, and ruin it there.</p>

<p>—What would your worship have me to do in this case?</p>

<p>—Tell it, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, by all means.—You are a
fool, <i>Tristram</i>, if you do.</p>

<p>O ye powers! (for powers ye are, and great ones too)—which
enable mortal man to tell a story worth the
hearing——that kindly shew him, where he is to begin
it—and where he is to end it——what he is to put
into it——and what he is to leave out—how much of
it he is to cast into a shade—and whereabouts he is to throw
his light!—Ye, who preside over this vast empire of
biographical freebooters, and see how many scrapes and plunges your
subjects hourly fall into;——will you do one thing?</p>

<p>I beg and beseech you (in case you will do nothing better for
us) that wherever in any part of your dominions it so falls out,
that three several roads meet in one point, as they have done just here——that
at least you set up a guide-post in the centre of them, in mere
charity, to direct an uncertain devil which of the three he is to
take.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HO</small>’ the shock my uncle
<i>Toby</i> received the year after the demolition of
<i>Dunkirk</i>, in his affair with widow <i>Wadman</i>, had fixed
him in a resolution never more to think of the sex—or of
aught which belonged to it;—yet corporal <i>Trim</i> had made
no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s case there was a strange and unaccountable
concurrence of circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay
siege to that fair and strong citadel.——In
<i>Trim</i>’s case there was a concurrence of nothing in the
world, but of him and <i>Bridget</i> in the kitchen;—though
in truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and
so fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle <i>Toby</i>
employed his time and genius in tagging of points——I am
persuaded the honest corporal would have laid down his arms, and
followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle
<i>Toby</i> sat down before the mistress—corporal <i>Trim</i>
incontinently took ground before the maid.</p>

<p>Now, my dear friend <i>Garrick</i>, whom I have so much cause to
esteem and honour—(why, or wherefore, ’tis no
matter)—can it escape your penetration—I defy
it—that so many play-wrights, and opificers of chit-chat have
ever since been working upon <i>Trim</i>’s and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s pattern.——I care not what
<i>Aristotle</i>, or <i>Pacuvius</i>, or <i>Bossu</i>, or
<i>Ricaboni</i> say—(though I never read one of
them)——there is not a greater difference between a
single-horse chair and madam <i>Pompadour</i>’s
<i>vis-a-vis;</i> than betwixt a single amour, and an amour thus
nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a grand
drama——Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind—is
quite lost in five acts—but that is neither here nor
there.</p>

<p>After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine
months on my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s quarter, a most minute
account of every particular of which shall be given in its proper
place, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, honest man! found it necessary to draw
off his forces and raise the siege somewhat indignantly.</p>

<p>
Corporal <i>Trim</i>, as I said, had made no such bargain either with
himself——or with any one else——the fidelity however of
his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken
with disgust——he contented himself with turning his part of the
siege into a blockade;—that is, he kept others off;—for though he
never after went to the house, yet he never met <i>Bridget</i> in the village,
but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her—or (as
circumstances directed) he would shake her by the hand—or ask her
lovingly how she did—or would give her a ribbon—and now-and-then,
though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give <i>Bridget</i>
a—
</p>

<p>Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five
years; that is from the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i> in the year
13, to the latter end of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s campaign in
the year 18, which was about six or seven weeks before the time
I’m speaking of.——When <i>Trim</i>, as his custom
was, after he had put my uncle <i>Toby</i> to bed, going down one
moon-shiny night to see that every thing was right at his
fortifications——in the lane separated from the
bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly—he espied his
<i>Bridget.</i></p>

<p>As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well
worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle
<i>Toby</i> had made, <i>Trim</i> courteously and gallantly took
her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so privately,
but that the foul-mouth’d trumpet of Fame carried it from ear
to ear, till at length it reach’d my father’s, with this untoward circumstance along with it, that my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s curious draw-bridge, constructed and
painted after the <i>Dutch</i> fashion, and which went quite across
the ditch—was broke down, and somehow or other crushed all to
pieces that very night.</p>

<p>My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s hobby-horse; he thought it the most
ridiculous horse that ever gentleman mounted; and indeed unless my
uncle <i>Toby</i> vexed him about it, could never think of it once,
without smiling at it——so that it could never get lame
or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father’s
imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to
his humour than any one which had yet befall’n it, it proved
an inexhaustible fund of entertainment to
him——Well——but dear <i>Toby!</i> my father
would say, do tell me seriously how this affair of the bridge
happened.——How can you teaze me so much about it? my
uncle <i>Toby</i> would reply—I have told it you twenty times, word for word as <i>Trim</i> told it
me.—Prithee, how was it then, corporal? my father would cry,
turning to <i>Trim.</i>—It was a mere misfortune, an’
please your honour;——I was shewing Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>
our fortifications, and in going too near the edge of the fosse, I
unfortunately slipp’d in——Very well, <i>Trim!</i>
my father would cry——(smiling mysteriously, and giving
a nod—but without interrupting him)——and being
link’d fast, an’ please your honour, arm in arm with
Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, I dragg’d her after me, by means of
which she fell backwards soss against the bridge——and
<i>Trim</i>’s foot (my uncle <i>Toby</i> would cry, taking
the story out of his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled
full against the bridge too.—It was a thousand to one, my
uncle <i>Toby</i> would add, that the poor fellow did not break his
leg.——Ay truly, my father would say——a limb
is soon broke, brother <i>Toby</i>, in such
encounters.——And so, an’ please your honour, the
bridge, which your honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us, and splintered all to
pieces.</p>

<p>At other times, but especially when my uncle <i>Toby</i> was so
unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or
petards—my father would exhaust all the stores of his
eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a panegyric upon the
<small>BATTERING-RAMS</small> of the ancients—the
<small>VINEA</small> which <i>Alexander</i> made use of at the
siege of Troy.—He would tell my uncle <i>Toby</i> of the
<small>CATAPULTÆ</small> of the <i>Syrians</i>, which threw
such monstrous stones so many hundred feet, and shook the strongest
bulwarks from their very foundation:—he would go on and
describe the wonderful mechanism of the <small>BALLISTA</small>
which <i>Marcellinus</i> makes so much rout about!—the
terrible effects of the <small>PYRABOLI</small>, which cast
fire;—the danger of the <small>TEREBRA</small> and
<small>SCORPIO</small>, which cast javelins.——But what
are these, would he say, to the destructive machinery of corporal
<i>Trim</i>?—Believe me, brother <i>Toby</i>, no
bridge, or bastion, or sally-port, that ever was constructed in this world, can hold out against such
artillery.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would never attempt any defence against the
force of this ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of
smoaking his pipe; in doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one
night after supper, that it set my father, who was a little
phthisical, into a suffocating fit of violent coughing: my uncle
<i>Toby</i> leap’d up without feeling the pain upon his
groin—and, with infinite pity, stood beside his
brother’s chair, tapping his back with one hand, and holding
his head with the other, and from time to time wiping his eyes with
a clean cambrick handkerchief, which he pulled out of his
pocket.——The affectionate and endearing manner in which
my uncle <i>Toby</i> did these little offices—cut my father
thro’ his reins, for the pain he had just been giving
him.——May my brains be knock’d out with a
battering-ram or a catapulta, I care not which, quoth my father to
himself—if ever I insult this worthy soul more!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> draw-bridge being held
irreparable, <i>Trim</i> was ordered directly to set about
another——but not upon the same model: for cardinal
<i>Alberoni</i>’s intrigues at that time being discovered,
and my uncle <i>Toby</i> rightly foreseeing that a flame would
inevitably break out betwixt <i>Spain</i> and the Empire, and that
the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be
either in <i>Naples</i> or <i>Sicily</i>——he determined
upon an <i>Italian</i> bridge—(my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
by-the-bye, was not far out of his conjectures)——but my
father, who was infinitely the better politician, and took the lead
as far of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in the cabinet, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> took it of him in the field——convinced him,
that if the king of <i>Spain</i> and the Emperor went together by
the ears, <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> and <i>Holland</i> must,
by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the lists
too;——and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother <i>Toby</i>, as sure as we are alive, will
fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old prize-fighting stage of
<i>Flanders;</i>—then what will you do with your
<i>Italian</i> bridge?</p>

<p>—We will go on with it then upon the old model, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>When corporal <i>Trim</i> had about half finished it in that
style——my uncle <i>Toby</i> found out a capital defect
in it, which he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned,
it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle,
one half of which turning to one side of the fosse, and the other
to the other; the advantage of which was this, that by dividing the
weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it impowered my uncle
<i>Toby</i> to raise it up or let it down with the end of his
crutch, and with one hand, which, as his garrison was weak, was as
much as he could well spare—but the disadvantages of such a
construction were insurmountable;——for by this means,
he would say, I leave one half of my bridge in my enemy’s possession——and pray of what
use is the other?</p>

<p>The natural remedy for this was, no doubt, to have his bridge
fast only at one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted
up together, and stand bolt upright——but that was
rejected for the reason given above.</p>

<p>For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one
of that particular construction which is made to draw back
horizontally, to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to
gain a passage—of which sorts your worship might have seen
three famous ones at <i>Spires</i> before its destruction—and
one now at <i>Brisac</i>, if I mistake not;—but my father
advising my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with great earnestness, to have
nothing more to do with thrusting bridges—and my uncle
foreseeing moreover that it would but perpetuate the memory of the
Corporal’s misfortune—he changed his mind for that of
the marquis <i>d’Hôpital</i>&nbsp;’s invention,
which the younger <i>Bernouilli</i> has so well and learnedly
described, as your worships may see——<i>Act. Erud.
Lips.</i> an. 1695—to these a lead weight is an eternal
balance, and keeps watch as well as a couple of centinels, inasmuch
as the construction of them was a curve line approximating to a
cycloid——if not a cycloid itself.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> understood the nature of a parabola as well
as any man in <i>England</i>—but was not quite such a master
of the cycloid;——he talked however about it every
day——the bridge went not
forwards.——We’ll ask somebody about it, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i> to <i>Trim.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIX</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> <i>Trim</i> came in and told my
father, that Dr. <i>Slop</i> was in the kitchen, and busy in making
a bridge—my uncle <i>Toby</i>——the affair of the
jack-boots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his
brain——took it instantly for granted that Dr.
<i>Slop</i> was making a model of the marquis
<i>d’Hôpital</i>&nbsp;’s
bridge.——’tis very obliging in him, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>;—pray give my humble service to Dr.
<i>Slop</i>, <i>Trim</i>, and tell him I thank him heartily.</p>

<p>Had my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head been a
<i>Savoyard</i>&nbsp;’s box, and my father peeping in all the
time at one end of it——it could not have given him a
more distinct conception of the operations of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s imagination, than what he had; so,
notwithstanding the catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter
imprecation about them, he was just beginning to
triumph——</p>

<p>When <i>Trim</i>’s answer, in an instant, tore the laurel
from his brows, and twisted it to pieces.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XX</small>
</h3>

<p>——T<small>HIS</small> unfortunate
draw-bridge of yours, quoth my father——God bless your
honour, cried <i>Trim</i>, ’tis a bridge for master’s
nose.——In bringing him into the world with his vile
instruments, he has crushed his nose, <i>Susannah</i> says, as flat as a pancake to his
face, and he is making a false bridge with a piece of cotton and a
thin piece of whalebone out of <i>Susannah</i>&nbsp;’s stays,
to raise it up.</p>

<p>——Lead me, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, to
my room this instant.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXI</small>
</h3>

<p>F<small>ROM</small> the first moment I sat down to
write my life for the amusement of the world, and my opinions for
its instruction, has a cloud insensibly been gathering over my
father.——A tide of little evils and distresses has been
setting in against him.—Not one thing, as he observed
himself, has gone right: and now is the storm thicken’d and
going to break, and pour down full upon his head.</p>

<p>
I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and melancholy frame of
mind that ever sympathetic breast was touched with.——My nerves
relax as I tell it.——Every line I write, I feel an abatement of the
quickness of my pulse, and of that careless alacrity with it, which every day
of my life prompts me to say and write a thousand things I should
not——And this moment that I last dipp’d my pen into my ink, I
could not help taking notice what a cautious air of sad composure and solemnity
there appear’d in my manner of doing it.——Lord! how different
from the rash jerks and hair-brain’d squirts thou art wont,
<i>Tristram</i>, to transact it with in other humours—dropping thy
pen——spurting thy ink about thy table and thy books—as if thy
pen and thy ink, thy books and furniture cost thee nothing!
</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXII</small>
</h3>

<p>——I
<small>WON</small>’<small>T</small> go about to argue the
point with you—’tis so——and I am persuaded
of it, madam, as much as can be, “That both man and woman
bear pain or sorrow (and, for aught I know, pleasure too) best in a
horizontal position.”</p>

<p>The moment my father got up into his chamber, he threw himself prostrate across his
bed in the wildest disorder imaginable, but at the same time in the
most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows, that
ever the eye of pity dropp’d a tear for.——The
palm of his right hand, as he fell upon the bed, receiving his
forehead, and covering the greatest part of both his eyes, gently
sunk down with his head (his elbow giving way backwards) till his
nose touch’d the quilt;——his left arm hung
insensible over the side of the bed, his knuckles reclining upon
the handle of the chamber-pot, which peep’d out beyond the
valance—his right leg (his left being drawn up towards his
body) hung half over the side of the bed, the edge of it pressing
upon his shin bone—He felt it not. A fix’d, inflexible
sorrow took possession of every line of his face.—He
sigh’d once——heaved his breast often—but
uttered not a word.</p>

<p>An old set-stitch’d chair, valanced and fringed around
with party coloured worsted bobs, stood at the bed’s
head, opposite to the side where my father’s head
reclined.—My uncle <i>Toby</i> sat him down in it.</p>

<p>Before an affliction is digested—consolation ever comes
too soon;—and after it is digested—it comes too late:
so that you see, madam, there is but a mark between these two, as
fine almost as a hair, for a comforter to take aim at:—my
uncle <i>Toby</i> was always either on this side, or on that of it,
and would often say, he believed in his heart he could as soon hit
the longitude; for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he
drew the curtain a little forwards, and having a tear at every
one’s service——he pull’d out a cambrick
handkerchief——gave a low sigh——but held his
peace.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——“<i>A<small>LL</small> is not
gain that is got into the purse.</i>”—So that
notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the oddest
books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the oddest way of thinking that ever man in it was
bless’d with, yet it had this drawback upon him after
all——that it laid him open to some of the oddest and
most whimsical distresses; of which this particular one, which he
sunk under at present, is as strong an example as can be given.</p>

<p>No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child’s
nose, by the edge of a pair of forceps—however scientifically
applied—would vex any man in the world, who was at so much
pains in begetting a child, as my father was—yet it will not
account for the extravagance of his affliction, nor will it justify
the un-christian manner he abandoned and surrendered himself up
to.</p>

<p>To explain this, I must leave him upon the bed for half an
hour—and my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his old fringed chair
sitting beside him.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>——I <small>THINK</small> it a very
unreasonable demand—cried my great-grandfather, twisting up
the paper, and throwing it upon the table.——By this
account, madam, you have but two thousand pounds fortune, and not a
shilling more—and you insist upon having three hundred pounds
a year jointure for it.—</p>

<p>—“Because,” replied my
great-grandmother, “you have little or no nose,
Sir.”—</p>

<p>Now before I venture to make use of the word <i>Nose</i> a
second time—to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon
it, in this interesting part of my story, it may not be amiss to
explain my own meaning, and define, with all possible exactness and
precision, what I would willingly be understood to mean by the
term: being of opinion, that ’tis owing to the negligence and
perverseness of writers in despising this precaution, and to nothing else——that all the polemical
writings in divinity are not as clear and demonstrative as those
upon <i>a Will o’ the Wisp</i>, or any other sound part of
philosophy, and natural pursuit; in order to which, what have you
to do, before you set out, unless you intend to go puzzling on to
the day of judgment——but to give the world a good
definition, and stand to it, of the main word you have most
occasion for——changing it, Sir, as you would a guinea,
into small coin?—which done—let the father of confusion
puzzle you, if he can; or put a different idea either into your
head, or your reader’s head, if he knows how.</p>

<p>In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as I am
engaged in—the neglect is inexcusable; and Heaven is witness,
how the world has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many
openings to equivocal strictures—and for depending so much as
I have done, all along, upon the cleanliness of my readers
imaginations.</p>

<p>——Here are two senses, cried <i>Eugenius</i>, as we walk’d along, pointing with
the fore finger of his right hand to the word <i>Crevice</i>, in
the one hundred and seventy-eighth page of the first volume of this
book of books,——here are two senses—quoth
he.—And here are two roads, replied I, turning short upon
him——a dirty and a clean one——which shall
we take?—The clean, by all means, replied <i>Eugenius.
Eugenius</i>, said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon
his breast——to define—is to
distrust.——Thus I triumph’d over <i>Eugenius;</i>
but I triumph’d over him as I always do, like a
fool.——’Tis my comfort, however, I am not an
obstinate one: therefore</p>

<p>I define a nose as follows—intreating only beforehand, and
beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age,
complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own
souls, to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the
devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other ideas into
their minds, than what I put into my definition—For by the word <i>Nose</i>,
throughout all this long chapter of noses, and in every other part
of my work, where the word <i>Nose</i> occurs—I declare, by
that word I mean a nose, and nothing more, or less.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>
——“B<small>ECAUSE</small>,” quoth my
great grandmother, repeating the words again—“you have
little or no nose, Sir.”——</p>

<p>S’death! cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand
upon his nose,—’tis not so small as that comes
to;——’tis a full inch longer than my
father’s.—Now, my great-grandfather’s nose was
for all the world like unto the noses of all the men, women, and
children, whom <i>Pantagruel</i> found dwelling upon the island of
<small>ENNASIN</small>.——By the way, if you would know
the strange way of getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a
people——you must read the book;——find it
out yourself, you never can.——</p>

<p>—’Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs.</p>

<p>—’Tis a full inch, continued my grandfather,
pressing up the ridge of his nose with his finger and thumb; and
repeating his assertion——’tis a full inch longer,
madam, than my father’s——You must mean your
uncle’s, replied my great-grandmother.</p>

<p>——My great-grandfather was convinced.—He
untwisted the paper, and signed the article.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>——W<small>HAT</small> an unconscionable
jointure, my dear, do we pay out of this small estate of ours,
quoth my grandmother to my grandfather.</p>

<p>My father, replied my grandfather, had no more nose, my dear,
saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my hand.</p>

<p>—Now, you must know, that my great-grandmother outlived my
grandfather twelve years; so that my father had the
jointure to pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half-yearly—(on
<i>Michaelmas</i> and <i>Lady-day</i>,)—during all that
time.</p>

<p>No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than
my father.——And as far as a hundred pounds went, he
would fling it upon the table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited
jerk of an honest welcome, which generous souls, and generous souls
only, are able to fling down money: but as soon as ever he
enter’d upon the odd fifty—he generally gave a loud
<i>Hem!</i> rubb’d the side of his nose leisurely with the
flat part of his fore finger——inserted his hand
cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his
wig—look’d at both sides of every guinea as he parted
with it——and seldom could get to the end of the fifty
pounds, without pulling out his handkerchief, and wiping his
temples.</p>

<p>Defend me, gracious Heaven! from those persecuting spirits who
make no allowances for these workings within us.—Never—O never may I lay down in their
tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of
education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from
ancestors!</p>

<p>For three generations at least this tenet in favour of long
noses had gradually been taking root in our
family.——T<small>RADITION</small> was all along on its
side, and I<small>NTEREST</small> was every half-year stepping in
to strengthen it; so that the whimsicality of my father’s
brain was far from having the whole honour of this, as it had of
almost all his other strange notions.—For in a great measure
he might be said to have suck’d this in with his
mother’s milk. He did his part however.——If
education planted the mistake (in case it was one) my father
watered it, and ripened it to perfection.</p>

<p>He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the
subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in
<i>England</i> could stand it out against an uninterrupted
succession of six or seven short noses.—And for the contrary
reason, he would generally add, That it must be one of
the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long
and jolly noses, following one another in a direct line, did not
raise and hoist it up into the best vacancies in the
kingdom.——He would often boast that the <i>Shandy</i>
family rank’d very high in king <i>Harry</i> the
VIIIth’s time, but owed its rise to no state engine—he
would say—but to that only;——but that, like other
families, he would add——it had felt the turn of the
wheel, and had never recovered the blow of my
great-grandfather’s nose.——It was an ace of clubs
indeed, he would cry, shaking his head—and as vile a one for
an unfortunate family as ever turn’d up trumps.</p>

<p>——Fair and softly, gentle reader!——where
is thy fancy carrying thee!——If there is truth in man,
by my great-grandfather’s nose, I mean the external organ of
smelling, or that part of man which stands prominent in his
face——and which painters say, in good jolly noses and
well-proportioned faces, should comprehend a full third——that is,
measured downwards from the setting on of the hair.</p>

<p>——What a life of it has an author, at this pass!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is a singular blessing, that
nature has form’d the mind of man with the same happy
backwardness and renitency against conviction, which is observed in
old dogs—“of not learning new tricks.”</p>

<p>What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher
that ever existed be whisk’d into at once, did he read such
books, and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as would
eternally be making him change sides!</p>

<p>Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all
this—He pick’d up an opinion, Sir, as a man in a state
of nature picks up an apple.—It becomes his own—and if
he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than give it up.</p>

<p>I am aware that <i>Didius</i>, the great civilian, will contest
this point; and cry out against me, Whence comes this man’s
right to this apple? <i>ex confesso</i>, he will say—things
were in a state of nature—The apple, is as much
<i>Frank</i>’s apple as <i>John</i>’s. Pray, Mr.
<i>Shandy</i>, what patent has he to shew for it? and how did it
begin to be his? was it, when he set his heart upon it? or when he
gathered it? or when he chew’d it? or when he roasted it? or
when he peel’d, or when he brought it home? or when he
digested?——or when he——?——For
’tis plain, Sir, if the first picking up of the apple, made
it not his—that no subsequent act could.</p>

<p>Brother <i>Didius</i>, <i>Tribonius</i> will answer—(now
<i>Tribonius</i> the civilian and church lawyer’s beard being
three inches and a half and three eighths longer than <i>Didius</i>
his beard—I’m glad he takes up the cudgels for me, so I
give myself no farther trouble about the answer.)—Brother
<i>Didius, Tribonius</i> will say, it is a decreed case, as you may
find it in the fragments of <i>Gregorius</i> and
<i>Hermogines</i>’s codes, and in all the codes from
<i>Justinian</i>’s down to the codes of <i>Louis</i> and
<i>Des Eaux</i>—That the sweat of a man’s brows, and
the exsudations of a man’s brains, are as much a man’s
own property as the breeches upon his backside;—which said
exsudations, &amp;c. being dropp’d upon the said apple by the
labour of finding it, and picking it up; and being moreover
indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex’d, by the
picker up, to the thing pick’d up, carried home, roasted,
peel’d, eaten, digested, and so on;——’tis
evident that the gatherer of the apple, in so doing, has
mix’d up something which was his own, with the apple which
was not his own, by which means he has acquired a
property;—or, in other words, the apple is
<i>John</i>’s apple.</p>

<p>By the same learned chain of reasoning my father stood up for
all his opinions; he had spared no pains in picking them up, and the more they lay out of the common way, the
better still was his title.——No mortal claimed them;
they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting
as in the case above, so that they might well and truly be said to
be of his own goods and chattels.—Accordingly he held fast by
’em, both by teeth and claws—would fly to whatever he
could lay his hands on—and, in a word, would intrench and
fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breast-works,
as my uncle <i>Toby</i> would a citadel.</p>

<p>There was one plaguy rub in the way of this——the
scarcity of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in case
of a smart attack; inasmuch as few men of great genius had
exercised their parts in writing books upon the subject of great
noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is incredible!
and I am quite lost in my understanding, when I am considering what
a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted
upon worse subjects—and how many millions of books in all languages and in all
possible types and bindings, have been fabricated upon points not
half so much tending to the unity and peace-making of the world.
What was to be had, however, he set the greater store by; and
though my father would oft-times sport with my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s library—which, by-the-bye, was ridiculous
enough—yet at the very same time he did it, he collected
every book and treatise which had been systematically wrote upon
noses, with as much care as my honest uncle <i>Toby</i> had done
those upon military architecture.——’Tis true, a
much less table would have held them—but that was not thy
transgression, my dear uncle.——</p>

<p>Here——but why here——rather than in any
other part of my story——I am not able to
tell:——but here it is——my heart stops me to
pay to thee, my dear uncle <i>Toby</i>, once for all, the tribute I
owe thy goodness.—Here let me thrust my chair aside, and
kneel down upon the ground, whilst I am pouring forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee,
and veneration for the excellency of thy character, that ever
virtue and nature kindled in a nephew’s
bosom.——Peace and comfort rest for evermore upon thy
head!—Thou enviedst no man’s
comforts——insultedst no man’s
opinions——Thou blackenedst no man’s
character—devouredst no man’s bread: gently, with
faithful <i>Trim</i> behind thee, didst thou amble round the little
circle of thy pleasures, jostling no creature in thy way:—for
each one’s sorrows, thou hadst a tear,—for each
man’s need, thou hadst a shilling.</p>

<p>Whilst I am worth one, to pay a weeder—thy path from thy
door to thy bowling-green shall never be grown
up.——Whilst there is a rood and a half of land in the
<i>Shandy</i> family, thy fortifications, my dear uncle
<i>Toby</i>, shall never be demolish’d.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father’s collection was not
great, but to make amends, it was curious; and consequently he was
some time in making it; he had the great good fortune hewever, to
set off well, in getting <i>Bruscambille</i>’s prologue upon
long noses, almost for nothing—for he gave no more for
<i>Bruscambille</i> than three half-crowns; owing indeed to the
strong fancy which the stall-man saw my father had for the book the
moment he laid his hands upon it.——There are not three
<i>Bruscambilles</i> in <i>Christendom</i>—said the
stall-man, except what are chain’d up in the libraries of the
curious. My father flung down the money as quick as
lightning——took <i>Bruscambille</i> into his
bosom——hied home from <i>Piccadilly</i> to
<i>Coleman</i>-street with it, as he would have hied home with a
treasure, without taking his hand once off from <i>Bruscambille</i>
all the way.</p>

<p>To those who do not yet know of which gender <i>Bruscambille</i>
is——inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily
be done by either——’twill be no objection against
the simile—to say, That when my father got home, he solaced
himself with <i>Bruscambille</i> after the manner in which,
’tis ten to one, your worship solaced yourself with your
first mistress——that is, from morning even unto night:
which, by-the-bye, how delightful soever it may prove to the
inamorato—is of little or no entertainment at all to
by-standers.——Take notice, I go no farther with the
simile—my father’s eye was greater than his
appetite—his zeal greater than his knowledge—he
cool’d—his affections became divided——he
got hold of <i>Prignitz</i>—purchased <i>Scroderus, Andrea
Paraeus, Bouchet</i>’s Evening Conferences, and above all,
the great and learned <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>; of which, as I
shall have much to say by-and-bye—I will say nothing now.</p>

<p>O<small>F</small> all the tracts my father was at
the pains to procure and study in support of his hypothesis, there
was not any one wherein he felt a more cruel disappointment at
first, than in the celebrated dialogue between <i>Pamphagus</i> and
<i>Cocles</i>, written by the chaste pen of the great and venerable
<i>Erasmus</i>, upon the various uses and seasonable applications
of long noses.——Now don’t let Satan, my dear
girl, in this chapter, take advantage of any one spot of rising
ground to get astride of your imagination, if you can any ways help
it; or if he is so nimble as to slip on—let me beg of you,
like an unback’d filly, <i>to frisk it, to squirt it, to jump
it, to rear it, to bound it—and to kick it, with long kicks
and short kicks</i>, till like <i>Tickletoby</i>’s mare, you
break a strap or a crupper, and throw his worship into the
dirt.—You need not kill him.—</p>

<p>—And pray who was <i>Tickletoby</i>’s
mare?—’tis just as discreditable and unscholar-like a
question, Sir, as to have asked what year (<i>ab. urb. con.</i>)
the second Punic war broke out.—Who was
<i>Tickletoby</i>’s mare!—Read, read, read, read, my
unlearned reader! read—or by the knowledge of the great saint
<i>Paraleipomenon</i>—I tell you before-hand, you had better
throw down the book at once; for without much reading, by which
your reverence knows I mean much knowledge, you will no more be
able to penetrate the moral of the next marbled page (motley emblem
of my work!) than the world with all its sagacity has been able to
unravel the many opinions, transactions, and truths which still lie
mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one.</p>

<p>“<i>N<small>IHIL</small> me paenitet
hujus nasi</i>,” quoth <i>Pamphagus</i>;——that
is—“My nose has been the making of
me.”——“<i>Nec est cur
poeniteat</i>,” replies <i>Cocles</i>; that is,
“How the duce should such a nose fail?”</p>

<p>The doctrine, you see, was laid down by <i>Erasmus</i>, as my
father wished it, with the utmost plainness; but my father’s
disappointment was, in finding nothing more from so able a pen, but
the bare fact itself; without any of that speculative subtilty or
ambidexterity of argumentation upon it, which Heaven had
bestow’d upon man on purpose to investigate truth, and fight
for her on all sides.——My father pish’d and
pugh’d at first most terribly——’tis worth
something to have a good name. As the dialogue was of
<i>Erasmus</i>, my father soon came to himself, and read it over
and over again with great application, studying every word and
every syllable of it thro’ and thro’ in its most strict
and literal interpretation—he could still make nothing of it,
that way. Mayhap there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my
father.——Learned men, brother <i>Toby</i>, don’t
write dialogues upon long noses for
nothing.——I’ll study the mystick and the
allegorick sense——here is some room to turn a
man’s self in, brother.</p>

<p>My father read on.——</p>

<p>Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships,
that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by
<i>Erasmus</i>, the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not
without its domestic conveniences also; for that in a case of
distress—and for want of a pair of bellows, it will do
excellently well, <i>ad ixcitandum focum</i> (to stir up the
fire.)</p>

<p>Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond
measure, and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within
him, as she had done the seeds of all other
knowledge——so that he had got out his penknife, and was
trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not
scratch some better sense into it.——I’ve got
within a single letter, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, of
<i>Erasmus</i> his mystic meaning.—You are near enough,
brother, replied my uncle, in all conscience.——Pshaw!
cried my father, scratching on——I might as well be
seven miles off.—I’ve done it—said my father,
snapping his fingers—See, my dear brother <i>Toby</i>, how I
have mended the sense.——But you have marr’d a
word, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.—My father put on his
spectacles——bit his lip——and tore out the
leaf in a passion.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXI</small>
</h3>

<p>O <i>S<small>LAWKENBERGIUS</small>!</i> thou
faithful analyzer of my <i>Disgrazias</i>—thou sad foreteller
of so many of the whips and short turns which on one stage or other
of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose,
and no other cause, that I am conscious of.—Tell me,
<i>Slawkenbergius!</i> what secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how
did it sound in thy ears?——art thou sure thou
heard’st it?——which first cried out to
thee——go——go, <i>Slawkenbergius!</i>
dedicate the labours of thy life—neglect thy
pastimes——call forth all the powers and faculties of
thy nature——macerate thyself in the service of mankind,
and write a grand <small>FOLIO</small> for them, upon the subject
of their noses.</p>

<p>How the communication was conveyed into
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>’s sensorium——so that
<i>Slawkenbergius</i> should know whose finger touch’d the
key—and whose hand it was that blew the bellows—as
<i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i> has been dead and laid in his grave
above fourscore and ten years——we can only raise
conjectures.</p>

<p><i>Slawkenbergius</i> was play’d upon, for aught I know,
like one of <i>Whitefield</i>’s disciples——that
is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the two
masters it was that had been practising upon his
<i>instrument</i>——as to make all reasoning upon it
needless.</p>

<p>——For in the account which <i>Hafen
Slawkenbergius</i> gives the world of his motives and occasions for
writing, and spending so many years of his life upon this one
work—towards the end of his prolegomena, which by-the-bye
should have come first——but the bookbinder has most
injudiciously placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the
book, and the book itself—he informs his reader, that ever
since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit
down cooly, and consider within himself the true state and
condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of his
being;——or—to shorten my translation, for
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>’s book is in <i>Latin</i>, and not a
little prolix in this passage—ever since I understood, quoth
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>, any thing—or rather <i>what was
what</i>——and could perceive that the point of long
noses had been too loosely handled by all who had gone
before;——have I <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, felt a strong
impulse, with a mighty and unresistible call within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.</p>

<p>And to do justice to <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, he has entered the
list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it
than any one man who had ever entered it before
him——and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be
<i>en-nich’d</i> as a prototype for all writers, of
voluminous works at least, to model their books by——for
he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject—examined every part
of it <i>dialectically</i>——then brought it into full
day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision
of his own natural parts could strike—or the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon
it—collating, collecting, and compiling——begging,
borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote
or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned:
so that <i>Slawkenbergius</i> his book may properly be considered,
not only as a model—but as a thorough-stitched <small>DIGEST</small> and regular
institute of <i>noses</i>, comprehending in it all that is or can
be needful to be known about them.</p>

<p>For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many
(otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father’s
collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses——or
collaterally touching them;——such for instance as
<i>Prignitz</i>, now lying upon the table before me, who with
infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like
examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of
twenty charnel-houses in <i>Silesia</i>, which he had
rummaged——has informed us, that the mensuration and
configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any
<i>given</i> tract of country, except <i>Crim Tartary</i>, where
they are all crush’d down by the thumb, so that no judgment
can be formed upon them—are much nearer alike, than the world
imagines;—the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere
trifle, not worth taking notice of;——but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by
which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is
owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose
ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell’d
and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but
a step from it (bating the case of idiots, whom <i>Prignitz</i>,
who had lived many years in <i>Turky</i>, supposes under the more
immediate tutelage of Heaven)—it so happens, and ever must,
says <i>Prignitz</i>, that the excellency of the nose is in a
direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the
wearer’s fancy.</p>

<p>It is for the same reason, that is, because ’tis all
comprehended in <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, that I say nothing likewise
of <i>Scroderus (Andrea)</i> who, all the world knows, set himself
to oppugn <i>Prignitz</i> with great violence—proving it in
his own way, first <i>logically</i>, and then by a series of
stubborn facts, “That so far was <i>Prignitz</i> from
the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary—the nose begat
the fancy.”</p>

<p>—The learned suspected <i>Scroderus</i> of an indecent
sophism in this—and <i>Prignitz</i> cried out aloud in the
dispute, that <i>Scroderus</i> had shifted the idea upon
him——but <i>Scroderus</i> went on, maintaining his
thesis.</p>

<p>My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two
sides he should take in this affair; when <i>Ambrose
Paræus</i> decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the
systems, both of <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i>, drove my
father out of both sides of the controversy at once.</p>

<p>Be witness——</p>

<p>I don’t acquaint the learned reader—in saying it, I
mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact
myself——</p>

<p>That this <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> was chief surgeon and
nose-mender to <i>Francis</i> the ninth of <i>France</i>, and in
high credit with him and the two preceding, or succeeding kings (I
know not which)—and that, except in the slip he made in his
story of <i>Taliacotius</i>’s noses, and his manner of setting them on—he was esteemed by the
whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in
matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.</p>

<p>Now <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> convinced my father, that the
true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention
of the world, and upon which <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i>
had wasted so much learning and fine parts——was neither
this nor that——but that the length and goodness of the
nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the
nurse’s breast——as the flatness and shortness of
<i>puisne</i> noses was to the firmness and elastic repulsion of
the same organ of nutrition in the hale and lively—which,
tho’ happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child,
inasmuch as his nose was so snubb’d, so rebuff’d, so
rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive <i>ad
mensuram suam legitimam</i>;——but that in case of the
flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother’s
breast—by sinking into it, quoth <i>Paraeus</i>, as into so much butter, the
nose was comforted, nourish’d, plump’d up,
refresh’d, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.</p>

<p>I have but two things to observe of <i>Paraeus</i>; first, That
he proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and
decorum of expression:—for which may his soul for ever rest
in peace!</p>

<p>And, secondly, that besides the systems of <i>Prignitz</i> and
<i>Scroderus</i>, which <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> his hypothesis
effectually overthrew—it overthrew at the same time the
system of peace and harmony of our family; and for three days
together, not only embroiled matters between my father and my
mother, but turn’d likewise the whole house and every thing
in it, except my uncle <i>Toby</i>, quite upside down.</p>

<p>Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife,
never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of
a street-door.</p>

<p>My mother, you must know———but I have fifty
things more necessary to let you know first—I have a hundred
difficulties which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand
distresses and domestick misadventures crowding in upon me thick
and threefold, one upon the neck of another. A cow broke in
(tomorrow morning) to my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s fortifications,
and eat up two rations and a half of dried grass, tearing up the
sods with it, which faced his horn-work and covered
way.——<i>Trim</i> insists upon being tried by a
court-martial—the cow to be shot—<i>Slop</i> to be
<i>crucifix’d</i>—myself to be <i>tristram’d</i>
and at my very baptism made a martyr of;——poor unhappy
devils that we all are!——I want
swaddling——but there is no time to be lost in
exclamations——I have left my father lying across his
bed, and my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his old fringed chair, sitting
beside him, and promised I would go back to them in half an hour;
and five-and-thirty minutes are laps’d
already.——Of all the perplexities a mortal author was
ever seen in—this certainly is the greatest, for I have
<i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>’s folio, Sir, to finish——a dialogue between my father and my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, upon the solution of <i>Prignitz, Scroderus,
Ambrose Paræus, Panocrates</i>, and <i>Grangousier</i> to
relate—a tale out of <i>Slawkenbergius</i> to translate, and
all this in five minutes less than no time at
all;——such a head!—would to Heaven my enemies
only saw the inside of it!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> was not any one scene more
entertaining in our family—and to do it justice in this
point;——and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the
table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration
to the world concerning this one article the more
solemn——that I believe in my soul (unless my love and
partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the supreme
Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a family
together (in that period at least of it which I have sat down to
write the story of)——where the characters of it were cast
or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this
end; or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes,
and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night,
were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the
S<small>HANDY</small> F<small>AMILY</small>.</p>

<p>Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this
whimsical theatre of ours——than what frequently arose
out of this self-same chapter of long noses——especially
when my father’s imagination was heated with the enquiry, and
nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
too.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would give my father all possible fair play
in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoking his
pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon
his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive
<i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i>’s solutions into it.</p>

<p>Whether they were above my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
reason——or contrary to it——or that his brain was like <i>damp</i>
timber, and no spark could possibly take hold——or that
it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military
disqualifications to his seeing clearly into <i>Prignitz</i> and
<i>Scroderus</i>’s doctrines——I say not—let
schoolmen—scullions, anatomists, and engineers, fight for it
among themselves——</p>

<p>’Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair,
that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and render out of
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>’s <i>Latin</i>, of which, as he was no
great master, his translation was not always of the
purest——and generally least so where ’twas most
wanted.—This naturally open’d a door to a second
misfortune;——that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal
to open my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s eyes——my
father’s ideas ran on as much faster than the translation, as
the translation outmoved my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s——neither the one or the other added
much to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> gift of ratiocination and making
syllogisms——I mean in man—for in superior classes
of being, such as angels and spirits——’tis all
done, may it please your worships, as they tell me, by
I<small>NTUITION</small>;—and beings inferior, as your
worships all know——syllogize by their noses: though
there is an island swimming in the sea (though not altogether at
its ease) whose inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not,
are so wonderfully gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion,
and oft-times to make very well out too:——but
that’s neither here nor there——</p>

<p>The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, or—the
great and principal act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell
us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
one with another, by the intervention of a third (called the
<i>medius terminus</i>); just as a man, as <i>Locke</i> well
observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same
length, which could not be brought together, to measure their
equality, by <i>juxta-position.</i></p>

<p>Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated
his systems of noses, and observed my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
deportment—what great attention he gave to every
word—and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what
wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of
it——surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his
finger and his thumb——then fore-right——then
this way, and then that, in all its possible directions and
fore-shortenings——he would have concluded my uncle
<i>Toby</i> had got hold of the <i>medius terminus</i>, and was
syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of
long noses, in order, as my father laid them before him. This,
by-the-bye, was more than my father wanted——his aim in
all the pains he was at in these philosophick lectures—was to
enable my uncle <i>Toby</i> not to
<i>discuss</i>——but <i>comprehend</i>—to <i>hold</i> the grains
and scruples of learning——not to <i>weigh</i>
them.——My uncle <i>Toby</i>, as you will read in the
next chapter, did neither the one or the other.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>’T<small>IS</small> a pity, cried my father
one winter’s night, after a three hours painful translation
of <i>Slawkenbergius</i>——’tis a pity, cried my
father, putting my mother’s threadpaper into the book for a
mark, as he spoke——that truth, brother <i>Toby</i>,
should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so
obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest
siege.——</p>

<p>Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s fancy, during the time of my
father’s explanation of <i>Prignitz</i> to
him——having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short
flight to the bowling-green;——his body might as well
have taken a turn there too—so that with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon the
<i>medius terminus</i>——my uncle <i>Toby</i> was in
fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its pros and cons,
as if my father had been translating <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>
from the <i>Latin</i> tongue into the <i>Cherokee.</i> But the word
<i>siege</i>, like a talismanic power, in my father’s
metaphor, wafting back my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s fancy, quick as
a note could follow the touch—he open’d his
ears——and my father observing that he took his pipe out
of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a
desire to profit—my father with great pleasure began his
sentence again——changing only the plan, and dropping
the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my
father apprehended from it.</p>

<p>’Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one
side, brother <i>Toby</i>——considering what ingenuity
these learned men have all shewn in their solutions of
noses.——Can noses be dissolved? replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>——My father thrust back his chair——rose up—put on his
hat——took four long strides to the
door——jerked it open——thrust his head half
way out——shut the door again——took no
notice of the bad hinge—returned to the
table—pluck’d my mother’s thread-paper out of
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>’s book——went hastily to his
bureau—walked slowly back—twisted my mother’s
thread-paper about his thumb—unbutton’d his
waistcoat—threw my mother’s thread-paper into the
fire——bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill’d
his mouth with bran—confounded it;—but mark!—the
oath of confusion was levell’d at my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s brain—which was e’en confused
enough already——the curse came charged only with the
bran—the bran, may it please your honours, was no more than
powder to the ball.</p>

<p>’Twas well my father’s passions lasted not long; for
so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on’t; and
it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with
in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my
father’s mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like
gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the
quaint simplicity of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
questions.——Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind
in so many different places all at one time—he could not have
exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds——or
started half so much, as with one single <i>quære</i> of
three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his
hobby-horsical career.</p>

<p>’Twas all one to my uncle <i>Toby</i>——he
smoked his pipe on with unvaried composure——his heart
never intended offence to his brother—and as his head could
seldom find out where the sting of it lay——he always
gave my father the credit of cooling by himself.——He
was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present
case.</p>

<p>By all that’s good! said my father, swearing, as he came
to himself, and taking the oath out of <i>Ernulphus</i>’s
digest of curses——(though to do my father
justice it was a fault (as he told Dr. <i>Slop</i> in the affair of
<i>Ernulphus</i>) which he as seldom committed as any man upon
earth)——By all that’s good and great! brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father, if it was not for the aids of
philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do—you would
put a man beside all temper.——Why, by the
<i>solutions</i> of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant, as
you might have known, had you favoured me with one grain of
attention, the various accounts which learned men of different
kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short and
long noses.——There is no cause but one, replied my
uncle <i>Toby</i>——why one man’s nose is longer
than another’s, but because that God pleases to have it
so.——That is <i>Grangousier</i>’s solution, said
my father.—’Tis he, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
looking up, and not regarding my father’s interruption, who
makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and
proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his infinite
wisdom,.——’Tis a pious account, cried my father,
but not philosophical—there is more religion in it than sound
science. ’Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s character——that he feared God, and
reverenced religion.——So the moment my father finished
his remark——my uncle <i>Toby</i> fell a whistling
<i>Lillabullero</i> with more zeal (though more out of tune) than
usual.—</p>

<p>What is become of my wife’s thread-paper?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXV</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>O</small> matter—as an appendage to
seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of some consequence to my
mother—of none to my father, as a mark in <i>Slawkenbergius.
Slawkenbergius</i> in every page of him was a rich treasure of
inexhaustible knowledge to my father—he could not open him
amiss; and he would often say in closing the book, that if all the
arts and sciences in the world, with the books which treated of them, were
lost—should the wisdom and policies of governments, he would
say, through disuse, ever happen to be forgot, and all that
statesmen had wrote or caused to be written, upon the strong or the
weak sides of courts and kingdoms, should they be forgot
also—and <i>Slawkenbergius</i> only left——there
would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to set the
world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he indeed! an
institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses, and every
thing else—at <i>matin</i>, noon, and vespers was <i>Hafen
Slawkenbergius</i> his recreation and delight: ’twas for ever
in his hands——you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a
canon’s prayer-book—so worn, so glazed, so contrited
and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts,
from one end even unto the other.</p>

<p>I am not such a bigot to <i>Slawkenbergius</i> as my
father;——there is a fund in him, no doubt: but in my
opinion, the best, I don’t say the most profitable, but
the most amusing part of <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>, is
his tales——and, considering he was a <i>German</i>,
many of them told not without fancy:——these take up his
second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are
comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten
tales——Philosophy is not built upon tales; and
therefore ’twas certainly wrong in <i>Slawkenbergius</i> to
send them into the world by that name!——there are a few
of them in his eighth, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem
rather playful and sportive, than speculative—but in general
they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many
independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon
the main hinges of his subject, and added to his work as so many
illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.</p>

<p>As we have leisure enough upon our hands——if you
give me leave, madam, I’ll tell you the ninth tale of his
tenth decad.</p>

S&nbsp;L&nbsp;A&nbsp;W&nbsp;K&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;B&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;G&nbsp;I&nbsp;U&nbsp;S’s<br>

T<small>&nbsp;A&nbsp;L&nbsp;E</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was one cool refreshing evening,
at the close of a very sultry day, in the latter end of the month
of <i>August</i>, when a stranger, mounted upon a dark mule, with a
small cloak-bag behind him, containing a few shirts, a pair of
shoes, and a crimson-sattin pair of breeches, entered the town of
<i>Strasburg.</i></p>

<p>He told the centinel, who questioned him as he entered the
gates, that he had been at the Promontory of
N<small>OSES</small>—was going on to
<i>Frankfort</i>——and should be back again at
<i>Strasburg</i> that day month, in his way to the borders of
<i>Crim Tartary.</i></p>

<p>The centinel looked up into the stranger’s
face——he never saw such a Nose in his life!</p>

<p>—I have made a very good venture of it, quoth the
stranger—so slipping his wrist out of the loop of a black
ribbon, to which a short scymetar was hung, he put his hand
into his pocket, and with great courtesy touching the fore part of
his cap with his left hand, as he extended his
right——he put a florin into the centinel’s hand,
and passed on.</p>

<p>It grieves, me, said the centinel, speaking to a little dwarfish
bandy- legg’d drummer, that so courteous a soul should have
lost his scabbard——he cannot travel without one to his
scymetar, and will not be able to get a scabbard to fit it in all
<i>Strasburg.</i>——I never had one, replied the
stranger, looking back to the centinel, and putting his hand up to
his cap as he spoke——I carry it, continued he,
thus——holding up his naked scymetar, his mule moving on
slowly all the time—on purpose to defend my nose.</p>

<p>It is well worth it, gentle stranger, replied the centinel.</p>

<p>——’Tis not worth a single stiver, said the
bandy-legg’d drummer——’tis a nose of
parchment.</p>

<p>As I am a true catholic—except that it is six times as big—’tis a nose, said
the centinel, like my own.</p>

<p>—I heard it crackle, said the drummer.</p>

<p>By dunder, said the centinel, I saw it bleed.</p>

<p>What a pity, cried the bandy-legg’d drummer, we did not
both touch it!</p>

<p>At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the
centinel and the drummer—was the same point debating betwixt
a trumpeter and a trumpeter’s wife, who were just then coming
up, and had stopped to see the stranger pass by.</p>

<p><i>Benedicity!</i>——What a nose! ’tis as long,
said the trumpeter’s wife, as a trumpet.</p>

<p>And of the same metal said the trumpeter, as you hear by its
sneezing.</p>

<p>’Tis as soft as a flute, said she.</p>

<p>—’Tis brass, said the trumpeter.</p>

<p>—’Tis a pudding’s end, said his wife.</p>

<p>I tell thee again, said the trumpeter, ’tis a brazen
nose,</p>

<p>I’ll know the bottom of it, said the trumpeter’s
wife, for I will touch it with my finger before I sleep.</p>

<p>The stranger’s mule moved on at so slow a rate, that he
heard every word of the dispute, not only betwixt the centinel and
the drummer, but betwixt the trumpeter and trumpeter’s
wife.</p>

<p>No! said he, dropping his reins upon his mule’s neck, and
laying both his hands upon his breast, the one over the other in a
saint-like position (his mule going on easily all the time) No!
said he, looking up—I am not such a debtor to the
world——slandered and disappointed as I have
been—as to give it that conviction——no! said he,
my nose shall never be touched whilst Heaven gives me
strength——To do what? said a burgomaster’s
wife.</p>

<p>The stranger took no notice of the burgomaster’s
wife——he was making a vow to <i>Saint Nicolas</i>;
which done, having uncrossed his arms with the same solemnity with
which he crossed them, he took up the reins of his bridle with his
left-hand, and putting his right hand into his bosom, with the
scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist of it, he rode on, as slowly as one foot of the mule could follow
another, thro’ the principal streets of <i>Strasburg</i>,
till chance brought him to the great inn in the market-place
over-against the church.</p>

<p>The moment the stranger alighted, he ordered his mule to be led
into the stable, and his cloak-bag to be brought in; then opening,
and taking out of it his crimson-sattin breeches, with a
silver-fringed—(appendage to them, which I dare not
translate)—he put his breeches, with his fringed cod-piece
on, and forth-with, with his short scymetar in his hand, walked out
to the grand parade.</p>

<p>The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade, when he
perceived the trumpeter’s wife at the opposite side of
it—so turning short, in pain lest his nose should be
attempted, he instantly went back to his inn—undressed
himself, packed up his crimson-sattin breeches, &amp;c. in his
cloak- bag, and called for his mule.</p>

<p>I am going forwards, said the stranger, for
<i>Frankfort</i>——and shall be back at <i>Strasburg</i>
this day month.</p>

<p>I hope, continued the stranger, stroking down the face of his
mule with his left hand as he was going to mount it, that you have
been kind to this faithful slave of mine—it has carried me
and my cloak-bag, continued he, tapping the mule’s back,
above six hundred leagues.</p>

<p>——’Tis a long journey, Sir, replied the master
of the inn——unless a man has great
business.——Tut! tut! said the stranger, I have been at
the promontory of Noses; and have got me one of the goodliest,
thank Heaven, that ever fell to a single man’s lot.</p>

<p>Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself, the
master of the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon
the stranger’s nose——By saint <i>Radagunda</i>,
said the inn-keeper’s wife to herself, there is more of it
than in any dozen of the largest noses put together in all
<i>Strasburg!</i> is it not, said she, whispering her husband in
his ear, is it not a noble nose?</p>

<p>’Tis an imposture, my dear, said the master of the
inn——’tis a false nose.</p>

<p>’Tis a true nose, said his wife.</p>

<p>’Tis made of fir-tree, said he, I smell the
turpentine.——</p>

<p>There’s a pimple on it, said she.</p>

<p>’Tis a dead nose, replied the inn-keeper.</p>

<p>’Tis a live nose, and if I am alive myself, said the
inn-keeper’s, wife, I will touch it.</p>

<p>I have made a vow to saint <i>Nicolas</i> this day, said the
stranger, that my nose shall not be touched till—Here the
stranger suspending his voice, looked up.——Till when?
said she hastily.</p>

<p>It never shall be touched, said he, clasping his hands and
bringing them close to his breast, till that hour—What hour?
cried the inn keeper’s wife.—Never!—never! said
the stranger, never till I am got—For Heaven’s sake,
into what place? said she——The stranger rode away
without saying a word.</p>

<p>The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards
<i>Frankfort</i> before all the city of <i>Strasburg</i> was in an
uproar about his nose. The <i>Compline</i> bells were just ringing
to call the <i>Strasburgers</i> to their devotions, and shut up the
duties of the day in prayer:—no soul in all <i>Strasburg</i>
heard ’em—the city was like a swarm of
bees——men, women, and children, (the <i>Compline</i>
bells tinkling all the time) flying here and there—in at one
door, out at another——this way and that way—long
ways and cross ways—up one street, down another
street——in at this alley, out of that——did
you see it? did you see it? did you see it? O! did you see
it?——who saw it? who did see it? for mercy’s
sake, who saw it?</p>

<p>Alack o’day! I was at vespers!—I was washing, I was
starching, I was scouring, I was quilting——God help me!
I never saw it——I never touch’d
it!——would I had been a centinel, a bandy-legg’d
drummer, a trumpeter, a trumpeter’s wife, was the general cry
and lamentation in every street and corner of
<i>Strasburg.</i></p>

<p>Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the
great city of <i>Strasburg</i>, was the courteous stranger going on
as gently upon his mule in his way to <i>Frankfort</i>, as if he
had no concern at all in the affair——talking all the
way he rode in broken sentences, sometimes to his
mule—sometimes to himself—sometimes to his Julia.</p>

<p>O Julia, my lovely Julia!—nay I cannot stop to let thee
bite that thistle——that ever the suspected tongue of a
rival should have robbed me of enjoyment when I was upon the point
of tasting it.——</p>

<p>——Pugh!—’tis nothing but a
thistle—never mind it—thou shalt have a better supper
at night.</p>

<p>——Banish’d from my country——my
friends——from thee.——</p>

<p>Poor devil, thou’rt sadly tired with thy
journey!——come—get on a little
faster—there’s nothing in my cloak-bag but two
shirts——a crimson-sattin pair of breeches, and a fringed——Dear
Julia!</p>

<p>——But why to <i>Frankfort?</i>—is it that
there is a hand unfelt, which secretly is conducting me through
these meanders and unsuspected tracts?</p>

<p>——Stumbling! by saint <i>Nicolas!</i> every
step—why at this rate we shall be all night in getting
in——</p>

<p>——To happiness——or am I to be the sport
of fortune and slander—destined to be driven forth
unconvicted——unheard——untouch’d——if
so, why did I not stay at <i>Strasburg</i>, where justice—but
I had sworn! Come, thou shalt drink—to <i>St.
Nicolas</i>—O Julia!——What dost thou prick up thy
ears at?——’tis nothing but a man, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The stranger rode on communing in this manner with his mule and
Julia—till he arrived at his inn, where, as soon as he
arrived, he alighted——saw his mule, as he had promised
it, taken good care of——took off his cloak-bag, with
his crimson-sattin breeches, &amp;c. in it—called for an
omelet to his supper, went to his bed about twelve o’clock, and in five
minutes fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was about the same hour when the tumult in <i>Strasburg</i>
being abated for that night,—the <i>Strasburgers</i> had all
got quietly into their beds—but not like the stranger, for
the rest either of their minds or bodies; queen <i>Mab</i>, like an
elf as she was, had taken the stranger’s nose, and without
reduction of its bulk, had that night been at the pains of slitting
and dividing it into as many noses of different cuts and fashions,
as there were heads in <i>Strasburg</i> to hold them. The abbess of
<i>Quedlingberg</i>, who with the four great dignitaries of her
chapter, the prioress, the deaness, the sub-chantress, and senior
canonness, had that week come to <i>Strasburg</i> to consult the
university upon a case of conscience relating to their placket-
holes——was ill all the night.</p>

<p>The courteous stranger’s nose had got perched upon the top
of the pineal gland of her brain, and made such rousing work in the
fancies of the four great dignitaries of her chapter, they could not get a wink of
sleep the whole night thro’ for it——there was no
keeping a limb still amongst them——in short, they got
up like so many ghosts.</p>

<p>
The penitentiaries of the third order of saint <i>Francis</i>——the
nuns of mount <i>Calvary</i>——the
<i>Præmonstratenses</i>——the <i>Clunienses</i><a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>——the
<i>Carthusians</i>, and all the severer orders of nuns, who lay that night in
blankets or hair-cloth, were still in a worse condition than the abbess of
<i>Quedlingberg</i>—by tumbling and tossing, and tossing and tumbling
from one side of their beds to the other the whole night long——the
several sisterhoods had scratch’d and maul’d themselves all to
death——they got out of their beds almost flay’d
alive—every body thought saint <i>Antony</i> had visited them for
probation with his fire——they had never once, in short, shut their
eyes the whole night long from vespers to matins.
</p>

<p>The nuns of saint <i>Ursula</i> acted the wisest—they
never attempted to go to bed at all.</p>

<p>The dean of <i>Strasburg</i>, the prebendaries, the capitulars
and domiciliars (capitularly assembled in the morning to consider
the case of butter’d buns) all wished they had followed the
nuns of saint <i>Ursula</i>’s example.——</p>

<p>In the hurry and confusion every thing had been in the night
before, the bakers had all forgot to lay their leaven—there
were no butter’d buns to be had for breakfast in all
<i>Strasburg</i>—the whole close of the cathedral was in one
eternal commotion——such a cause of restlessness and
disquietude, and such a zealous inquiry into that cause of the
restlessness, had never happened in <i>Strasburg</i>, since
<i>Martin Luther</i>, with his doctrines, had turned the city
upside down.</p>

<p>
If the stranger’s nose took this liberty of thrusting himself thus into
the dishes<a href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> of religious orders, &amp;c. what a
carnival did his nose make of it, in those of the laity!—’tis more
than my pen, worn to the stump as it is, has power to describe; tho’, I
acknowledge, (<i>cries</i> Slawkenbergius <i>with more gaiety of thought than I
could have expected from him</i>) that there is many a good simile now
subsisting in the world which might give my countrymen some idea of it; but at
the close of such a folio as this, wrote for their sakes, and in which I have
spent the greatest part of my life——tho’ I own to them the
simile is in being, yet would it not be unreasonable in them to expect I should
have either time or inclination to search for it? Let it suffice to say, that
the riot and disorder it occasioned in the <i>Strasburgers</i> fantasies was so
general—such an overpowering mastership had it got of all the faculties
of the <i>Strasburgers</i> minds—so many strange things, with equal
confidence on all sides, and with equal eloquence in all places, were spoken
and sworn to concerning it, that turned the whole stream of all discourse and
wonder towards it—every soul, good and bad—rich and
poor—learned and unlearned——doctor and
student——mistress and maid——gentle and
simple——nun’s flesh and woman’s flesh, in
<i>Strasburg</i> spent their time in hearing tidings about it—every eye
in <i>Strasburg</i> languished to see it——every
finger——every thumb in <i>Strasburg</i> burned to touch it.
</p>

<p>Now what might add, if any thing may be thought necessary to
add, to so vehement a desire—was this, that the centinel, the
bandy-legg’d drummer, the trumpeter, the trumpeter’s
wife, the burgomaster’s widow, the master of the inn, and the
master of the inn’s wife, how widely soever they all differed
every one from another in their testimonies and description of the
stranger’s nose—they all agreed together in two
points—namely, that he was gone to <i>Frankfort</i>, and
would not return to <i>Strasburg</i> till that day month; and secondly, whether his nose was true or
false, that the stranger himself was one of the most perfect
paragons of beauty—the finest-made man—the most
genteel!—the most generous of his purse—the most
courteous in his carriage, that had ever entered the gates of
<i>Strasburg</i>—that as he rode, with scymetar slung loosely
to his wrist, thro’ the streets—and walked with his
crimson-sattin breeches across the parade—’twas with so
sweet an air of careless modesty, and so manly
withal——as would have put the heart in jeopardy (had
his nose not stood in his way) of every virgin who had cast her
eyes upon him.</p>

<p>I call not upon that heart which is a stranger to the throbs and
yearnings of curiosity, so excited, to justify the abbess of
<i>Quedlingberg</i>, the prioress, the deaness, and sub-chantress,
for sending at noon-day for the trumpeter’s wife: she went
through the streets of <i>Strasburg</i> with her husband’s
trumpet in her hand,——the best apparatus the straitness
of the time would allow her, for the illustration of her theory—she staid no longer than
three days.</p>

<p>The centinel and bandy-legg’d
drummer!——nothing on this side of old <i>Athens</i>
could equal them! they read their lectures under the city-gates to
comers and goers, with all the pomp of a <i>Chrysippus</i> and a
<i>Crantor</i> in their porticos.</p>

<p>The master of the inn, with his ostler on his left-hand, read
his also in the same stile—under the portico or gateway of
his stable-yard—his wife, hers more privately in a back room:
all flocked to their lectures; not promiscuously—but to this
or that, as is ever the way, as faith and credulity marshal’d
them——in a word, each <i>Strasburger</i> came crouding
for intelligence—and every <i>Strasburger</i> had the
intelligence he wanted.</p>

<p>’Tis worth remarking, for the benefit of all demonstrators
in natural philosophy, &amp;c. that as soon as the
trumpeter’s wife had finished the abbess of
<i>Quedlingberg</i>’s private lecture, and had begun to read
in public, which she did upon a stool in the middle of the great
parade,——she incommoded the other demonstrators
mainly, by gaining incontinently the most fashionable part of the
city of <i>Strasburg</i> for her auditory—But when a
demonstrator in philosophy (cries <i>Slawkenbergius</i>) has a
<i>trumpet</i> for an apparatus, pray what rival in science can
pretend to be heard besides him?</p>

<p>Whilst the unlearned, thro’ these conduits of
intelligence, were all busied in getting down to the bottom of the
well, where <small>TRUTH</small> keeps her little
court——were the learned in their way as busy in pumping
her up thro’ the conduits of dialect
induction——they concerned themselves not with
facts——they reasoned——</p>

<p>Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than
the Faculty—had not all their disputes about it run into the
affair of <i>Wens</i> and œdematous swellings, they could not
keep clear of them for their bloods and souls——the
stranger’s nose had nothing to do either with wens or
œdematous swellings.</p>

<p>It was demonstrated however very satisfactorily, that such a ponderous mass of
heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated to the
nose, whilst the infant was <i>in Utera</i>, without destroying the
statical balance of the fœtus, and throwing it plump upon its
head nine months before the time.——</p>

<p>——The opponents granted the theory——they
denied the consequences.</p>

<p>And if a suitable provision of veins, arteries, &amp;c. said
they, was not laid in, for the due nourishment of such a nose, in
the very first stamina and rudiments of its formation, before it
came into the world (bating the case of Wens) it could not
regularly grow and be sustained afterwards.</p>

<p>This was all answered by a dissertation upon nutriment, and the
effect which nutriment had in extending the vessels, and in the
increase and prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest
growth and expansion imaginable—In the triumph of which
theory, they went so far as to affirm, that there was no cause
in nature, why a nose might not grow to the size of the
man himself.</p>

<p>The respondents satisfied the world this event could never
happen to them so long as a man had but one stomach and one pair of
lungs——For the stomach, said they, being the only organ
destined for the reception of food, and turning it into
chyle—and the lungs the only engine of
sanguification—it could possibly work off no more, than what
the appetite brought it: or admitting the possibility of a
man’s overloading his stomach, nature had set bounds however
to his lungs—the engine was of a determined size and
strength, and could elaborate but a certain quantity in a given
time——that is, it could produce just as much blood as
was sufficient for one single man, and no more; so that, if there
was as much nose as man——they proved a mortification
must necessarily ensue; and forasmuch as there could not be a
support for both, that the nose must either fall off from the
man, or the man inevitably fall off from his nose.</p>

<p>Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies, cried the
opponents—else what do you say to the case of a whole
stomach—a whole pair of lungs, and but half a man, when both
his legs have been unfortunately shot off?</p>

<p>He dies of a plethora, said they—or must spit blood, and
in a fortnight or three weeks go off in a
consumption.——</p>

<p>——It happens otherwise—replied the
opponents.——</p>

<p>It ought not, said they.</p>

<p>The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her
doings, though they went hand in hand a good way together, yet they
all divided about the nose at last, almost as much as the Faculty
itself.</p>

<p>They amicably laid it down, that there was a just and
geometrical arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the
human frame to its several destinations, offices, and functions,
which could not be transgressed but within certain limits—that
nature, though she sported——she sported within a
certain circle;—and they could not agree about the diameter
of it.</p>

<p>The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than
any of the classes of the literati;——they began and
ended with the word Nose; and had it not been for a <i>petitio
principii</i>, which one of the ablest of them ran his head against
in the beginning of the combat, the whole controversy had been
settled at once.</p>

<p>A nose, argued the logician, cannot bleed without
blood—and not only blood—but blood circulating in it to
supply the phænomenon with a succession of drops—(a
stream being but a quicker succession of drops, that is included,
said he.)——Now death, continued the logician, being
nothing but the stagnation of the blood——</p>

<p>I deny the definition——Death is the separation of
the soul from the body, said his antagonist——Then we
don’t agree about our weapons, said the
logician—Then there is an end of the dispute, replied the
antagonist.</p>

<p>The civilians were still more concise: what they offered being
more in the nature of a decree——than a dispute.</p>

<p>Such a monstrous nose, said they, had it been a true nose, could
not possibly have been suffered in civil society——and
if false—to impose upon society with such false signs and
tokens, was a still greater violation of its rights, and must have
had still less mercy shewn it.</p>

<p>The only objection to this was, that if it proved any thing, it
proved the stranger’s nose was neither true nor false.</p>

<p>
This left room for the controversy to go on. It was maintained by the advocates
of the ecclesiastic court, that there was nothing to inhibit a decree, since
the stranger <i>ex mero motu</i> had confessed he had been at the Promontory of
Noses, and had got one of the goodliest, &amp;c. &amp;c.——To this
it was answered, it was impossible there should be such a place as the
Promontory of Noses, and the learned be ignorant where it lay. The commissary
of the bishop of <i>Strasburg</i> undertook the advocates, explained this
matter in a treatise upon proverbial phrases, shewing them, that the Promontory
of Noses was a mere allegorick expression, importing no more than that nature
had given him a long nose: in proof of which, with great learning, he cited the
underwritten authorities,<a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> which had decided the point
incontestably, had it not appeared that a dispute about some franchises of dean
and chapter-lands had been determined by it nineteen years before.
</p>

<p>It happened——I must say unluckily for Truth, because
they were giving her a lift another way in so doing; that the two
universities of <i>Strasburg</i>——the <i>Lutheran</i>,
founded in the year 1538 by <i>Jacobus Surmis</i>, counsellor of
the senate,——and the <i>Popish</i>, founded by
<i>Leopold</i>, arch-duke of <i>Austria</i>, were, during all this
time, employing the whole depth of their knowledge (except just
what the affair of the abbess of <i>Quedlingberg</i>’s
placket-holes required)——in determining the point of
<i>Martin Luther</i>’s damnation.</p>

<p>The <i>Popish</i> doctors had undertaken to demonstrate
<i>à priori</i>, that from the necessary influence of the
planets on the twenty-second day of <i>October</i>
1483——when the moon was in the twelfth house,
<i>Jupiter, Mars</i>, and <i>Venus</i> in the third, the <i>Sun,
Saturn</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>, all got together in the
fourth—that he must in course, and unavoidably, be a
damn’d man—and that his doctrines, by a direct
corollary, must be damn’d doctrines too.</p>

<p>
By inspection into his horoscope, where five planets were in coition all at
once with Scorpio<a href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> (in reading this my father would always
shake his head) in the ninth house, with the <i>Arabians</i> allotted to
religion—it appeared that <i>Martin Luther</i> did not care one stiver
about the matter——and that from the horoscope directed to the
conjunction of <i>Mars</i>—they made it plain likewise he must die
cursing and blaspheming——with the blast of which his soul (being
steep’d in guilt) sailed before the wind, in the lake of hell-fire.
</p>

<p>The little objection of the <i>Lutheran</i> doctors to this, was, that it must certainly be the
soul of another man, born <i>Oct.</i> 22, 83. which was forced to
sail down before the wind in that manner—inasmuch as it
appeared from the register of <i>Islaben</i> in the county of
<i>Mansfelt</i>, that <i>Luther</i> was not born in the year 1483,
but in 84; and not on the 22d day of <i>October</i>, but on the
10th of <i>November</i>, the eve of <i>Martinmas</i> day, from
whence he had the name of <i>Martin.</i></p>

<p>[——I must break off my translation for a moment; for
if I did not, I know I should no more be able to shut my eyes in
bed, than the abbess of <i>Quedlingberg</i>——It is to
tell the reader; that my father never read this passage of
<i>Slawkenbergius</i> to my uncle <i>Toby</i>, but with
triumph——not over my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for he never
opposed him in it——but over the whole world.</p>

<p>—Now you see, brother <i>Toby</i>, he would say, looking
up, “that christian names are not such indifferent
things;”——had <i>Luther</i> here been called by
any other name but <i>Martin</i>, he would have been damn’d to all
eternity——Not that I look upon <i>Martin</i>, he would
add, as a good name——far from
it——’tis something better than a neutral, and but
a little——yet little as it is you see it was of some
service to him.</p>

<p>My father knew the weakness of this prop to his hypothesis, as
well as the best logician could shew him——yet so
strange is the weakness of man at the same time, as it fell in his
way, he could not for his life but make use of it; and it was
certainly for this reason, that though there are many stories in
<i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>’s Decades full as entertaining as
this I am translating, yet there is not one amongst them which my
father read over with half the delight——it flattered
two of his strangest hypotheses together——his
N<small>AMES</small> and his N<small>OSES</small>.——I
will be bold to say, he might have read all the books in the
<i>Alexandrian</i> Library, had not fate taken other care of them,
and not have met with a book or passage in one, which hit two such
nails as these upon the head at one stroke.]</p>

<p>The two universities of <i>Strasburg</i> were hard tugging at
this affair of <i>Luther</i>’s navigation. The Protestant
doctors had demonstrated, that he had not sailed right before the
wind, as the Popish doctors had pretended; and as every one knew
there was no sailing full in the teeth of it—they were going
to settle, in case he had sailed, how many points he was off;
whether <i>Martin</i> had doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a
lee-shore; and no doubt, as it was an enquiry of much edification,
at least to those who understood this sort of
<small>NAVIGATION</small>, they had gone on with it in spite of the
size of the stranger’s nose, had not the size of the
stranger’s nose drawn off the attention of the world from
what they were about—it was their business to follow.</p>

<p>The abbess of <i>Quedlingberg</i> and her four dignitaries was
no stop; for the enormity of the stranger’s nose running full
as much in their fancies as their case of
conscience——the affair of their placket-holes kept
cold—in a word, the printers were ordered to distribute their
types——all controversies dropp’d.</p>

<p>’Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of
it—to a nut-shell—to have guessed on which side of the
nose the two universities would split.</p>

<p>’Tis above reason, cried the doctors on one side.</p>

<p>’Tis below reason, cried the others.</p>

<p>’Tis faith, cried one.</p>

<p>’Tis a fiddle-stick, said the other.</p>

<p>’Tis possible, cried the one.</p>

<p>’Tis impossible, said the other.</p>

<p>God’s power is infinite, cried the Nosarians, he can do
any thing.</p>

<p>He can do nothing, replied the Anti-nosarians, which implies
contradictions.</p>

<p>He can make matter think, said the Nosarians.</p>

<p>As certainly as you can make a velvet cap out of a sow’s
ear, replied the Anti-nosarians.</p>

<p>He cannot make two and two five, replied the Popish
doctors.——’Tis false, said their other
opponents.——</p>

<p>Infinite power is infinite power, said the doctors who
maintained the <i>reality</i> of the nose.—It extends only to
all possible things, replied the <i>Lutherans.</i></p>

<p>By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose,
if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of <i>Strasburg.</i></p>

<p>Now the steeple of <i>Strasburg</i> being the biggest and the
tallest church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the
Anti-nosarians denied that a nose of 575 geometrical feet in length
could be worn, at least by a middle-siz’d
man——The Popish doctors swore it could—The
<i>Lutheran</i> doctors said No;—it could not.</p>

<p>This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great
way, upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural
attributes of God—That controversy led them naturally into
<i>Thomas Aquinas</i>, and <i>Thomas Aquinas</i> to the devil.</p>

<p>The stranger’s nose was no more heard of in the
dispute—it just served as a frigate to launch them into the
gulph of school-divinity——and then they all
sailed before the wind.</p>

<p>Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge.</p>

<p>The controversy about the attributes, &amp;c. instead of
cooling, on the contrary had inflamed the <i>Strasburgers</i>
imaginations to a most inordinate degree——The less they
understood of the matter the greater was their wonder about
it—they were left in all the distresses of desire
unsatisfied——saw their doctors, the
<i>Parchmentarians</i>, the <i>Brassarians</i>, the
<i>Turpentarians</i>, on one side—the Popish doctors on the
other, like <i>Pantagruel</i> and his companions in quest of the
oracle of the bottle, all embarked out of sight.</p>

<p>——The poor <i>Strasburgers</i> left upon the
beach!</p>

<p>——What was to be done?—No delay—the
uproar increased——every one in
disorder——the city gates set open.——</p>

<p>Unfortunate <i>Strasbergers!</i> was there in the store-house of
nature——was there in the lumber-rooms of learning——was
there in the great arsenal of chance, one single engine left
undrawn forth to torture your curiosities, and stretch your
desires, which was not pointed by the hand of Fate to play upon
your hearts?——I dip not my pen into my ink to excuse
the surrender of yourselves—’tis to write your
panegyrick. Shew me a city so macerated with
expectation——who neither eat, or drank, or slept, or
prayed, or hearkened to the calls either of religion or nature, for
seven-and-twenty days together, who could have held out one day
longer.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth the courteous stranger had promised to
return to <i>Strasburg.</i></p>

<p>Seven thousand coaches (<i>Slawkenbergius</i> must certainly
have made some mistake in his numeral characters) 7000
coaches——15000 single-horse chairs—20000 waggons,
crowded as full as they could all hold with senators, counsellors,
syndicks—beguines, widows, wives, virgins, canons,
concubines, all in their coaches—The abbess of
<i>Quedlingberg</i>, with the prioress, the deaness and
sub-chantress, leading the procession in one coach, and the dean of
<i>Strasburg</i>, with the four great dignitaries of his chapter,
on her left-hand—the rest following higglety-pigglety as they
could; some on horseback——some on
foot——some led——some
driven——some down the <i>Rhine</i>——some
this way——some that——all set out at
sun-rise to meet the courteous stranger on the road.</p>

<p>Haste we now towards the catastrophe of my tale——I
say <i>Catastrophe</i> (cries <i>Slawkenbergius</i>) inasmuch as a
tale, with parts rightly disposed, not only rejoiceth
(<i>gaudet</i>) in the <i>Catastrophe</i> and <i>Peripeitia</i> of
a D<small>RAMA</small>, but rejoiceth moreover in all the essential
and integrant parts of it——it has its <i>Protasis,
Epitasis, Catastasis</i>, its <i>Catastrophe</i> or
<i>Peripeitia</i> growing one out of the other in it, in the order
<i>Aristotle</i> first planted them——without which a
tale had better never be told at all, says <i>Slawkenbergius</i>,
but be kept to a man’s self.</p>

<p>In all my ten tales, in all my ten decades, have I
<i>Slawkenbergius</i> tied down every tale of them as tightly to
this rule, as I have done this of the stranger and his nose.</p>

<p>——From his first parley with the centinel, to his
leaving the city of <i>Strasburg</i>, after pulling off his
crimson-sattin pair of breeches, is the <i>Protasis</i> or first
entrance——where the characters of the <i>Personæ
Dramatis</i> are just touched in, and the subject slightly
begun.</p>

<p>The <i>Epitasis</i>, wherein the action is more fully entered
upon and heightened, till it arrives at its state or height called
the <i>Catastasis</i>, and which usually takes up the 2d and 3d
act, is included within that busy period of my tale, betwixt the
first night’s uproar about the nose, to the conclusion of the
trumpeter’s wife’s lectures upon it in the middle of
the grand parade: and from the first embarking of the learned in
the dispute—to the doctors finally sailing away, and leaving
the <i>Strasburgers</i> upon the beach in distress, is the
<i>Catastasis</i> or the ripening of the incidents and passions for their bursting
forth in the fifth act.</p>

<p>This commences with the setting out of the <i>Strasburgers</i>
in the <i>Frankfort</i> road, and terminates in unwinding the
labyrinth and bringing the hero out of a state of agitation (as
<i>Aristotle</i> calls it) to a state of rest and quietness.</p>

<p>This, says <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>, constitutes the
<i>Catastrophe</i> or <i>Peripeitia</i> of my tale—and that
is the part of it I am going to relate.</p>

<p>We left the stranger behind the curtain asleep——he
enters now upon the stage.</p>

<p>—What dost thou prick up thy ears at?—’tis
nothing but a man upon a horse——was the last word the
stranger uttered to his mule. It was not proper then to tell the
reader, that the mule took his master’s word for it; and
without any more <i>ifs</i> or <i>ands</i>, let the traveller and
his horse pass by.</p>

<p>The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to
<i>Strasburg</i> that night. What a fool am I, said the
traveller to himself, when he had rode about a league farther,
to think of getting into <i>Strasburg</i> this
night.—<i>Strasburg!</i>——the great
<i>Strasburg!</i>——<i>Strasburg</i>, the capital of all
<i>Alsatia!</i> <i>Strasburg</i>, an imperial city!
<i>Strasburg</i>, a sovereign state! <i>Strasburg</i>, garrisoned
with five thousand of the best troops in all the world!—Alas!
if I was at the gates of <i>Strasburg</i> this moment, I could not
gain admittance into it for a ducat—nay a ducat and
half—’tis too much—better go back to the last inn
I have passed——than lie I know not
where——or give I know not what. The traveller, as he
made these reflections in his mind, turned his horse’s head
about, and three minutes after the stranger had been conducted into
his chamber, he arrived at the same inn.</p>

<p>——We have bacon in the house, said the host, and
bread——and till eleven o’clock this night had
three eggs in it——but a stranger, who arrived an hour
ago, has had them dressed into an omelet, and we have
nothing.——</p>

<p>Alas! said the traveller, harassed as I am, I want nothing but a
bed.——I have one as soft as is in <i>Alsatia</i>, said
the host.</p>

<p>——The stranger, continued he, should have slept in
it, for ’tis my best bed, but upon the score of his
nose.——He has got a defluxion, said the
traveller.——Not that I know, cried the
host.——But ’tis a camp-bed, and <i>Jacinta</i>,
said he, looking towards the maid, imagined there was not room in
it to turn his nose in.——Why so? cried the traveller,
starting back.—It is so long a nose, replied the
host.——The traveller fixed his eyes upon
<i>Jacinta</i>, then upon the ground—kneeled upon his right
knee—had just got his hand laid upon his
breast——Trifle not with my anxiety, said he rising up
again.——’Tis no trifle, said <i>Jacinta</i>,
’tis the most glorious nose!——The traveller fell
upon his knee again—laid his hand upon his breast—then,
said he, looking up to heaven, thou hast conducted me to the end of
my pilgrimage—’Tis <i>Diego.</i></p>

<p>The traveller was the brother of the <i>Julia</i>, so often
invoked that night by the stranger as he rode from <i>Strasburg</i>
upon his mule; and was come, on her part, in quest of him. He had
accompanied his sister from <i>Valadolid</i> across the
<i>Pyrenean</i> mountains through <i>France</i>, and had many an
entangled skein to wind off in pursuit of him through the many
meanders and abrupt turnings of a lover’s thorny tracks.</p>

<p>——<i>Julia</i> had sunk under it——and
had not been able to go a step farther than to <i>Lyons</i>, where,
with the many disquietudes of a tender heart, which all talk
of——but few feel—she sicken’d, but had just
strength to write a letter to <i>Diego</i>; and having conjured her
brother never to see her face till he had found him out, and put
the letter into his hands, <i>Julia</i> took to her bed.</p>

<p><i>Fernandez</i> (for that was her brother’s
name)——tho’ the camp-bed was as soft as any one
in <i>Alsace</i>, yet he could not shut his eyes in
it.——As soon as it was day he rose, and hearing
<i>Diego</i> was risen too, he entered his chamber, and discharged his
sister’s commission.</p>

<p>The letter was as follows:</p>

<p>“Seig. D<small>IEGO</small>,</p>

<p>“Whether my suspicions of your nose were justly
excited or not——’tis not now to inquire—it
is enough I have not had firmness to put them to farther tryal.</p>

<p>“How could I know so little of myself, when I sent
my <i>Duenna</i> to forbid your coming more under my lattice? or
how could I know so little of you, <i>Diego</i>, as to imagine you
would not have staid one day in <i>Valadolid</i> to have given ease
to my doubts?—Was I to be abandoned, <i>Diego</i>, because I
was deceived? or was it kind to take me at my word, whether my
suspicions were just or no, and leave me, as you did, a prey to
much uncertainty and sorrow?</p>

<p>“In what manner <i>Julia</i> has resented
this——my brother, when he puts this letter into your
hands, will tell you; He will tell you in how few moments she
repented of the rash message she had sent you——in what
frantic haste she flew to her lattice, and how many days and nights
together she leaned immoveably upon her elbow, looking through it
towards the way which <i>Diego</i> was wont to come.</p>

<p>“He will tell you, when she heard of your
departure—how her spirits deserted her——how her
heart sicken’d——how piteously she
mourned——how low she hung her head. O <i>Diego!</i> how
many weary steps has my brother’s pity led me by the hand
languishing to trace out yours; how far has desire carried me
beyond strength——and how oft have I fainted by the way,
and sunk into his arms, with only power to cry out—O my
<i>Diego!</i></p>

<p>“If the gentleness of your carriage has not belied
your heart, you will fly to me, almost as fast as you fled from
me—haste as you will——you will arrive but to see
me expire.——’Tis a bitter draught,
<i>Diego</i>, but oh! ’tis embittered still more by dying
<i>un</i>———”</p>

<p>She could proceed no farther.</p>

<p><i>Slawkenbergius</i> supposes the word intended was
unconvinced, but her strength would not enable her to finish her
letter.</p>

<p>The heart of the courteous <i>Diego</i> over-flowed as he read
the letter——he ordered his mule forthwith and
<i>Fernandez</i>’s horse to be saddled; and as no vent in
prose is equal to that of poetry in such
conflicts——chance, which as often directs us to
remedies as to <i>diseases</i>, having thrown a piece of charcoal
into the window——<i>Diego</i> availed himself of it,
and whilst the hostler was getting ready his mule, he eased his
mind against the wall as follows.</p>

<p class="center">
O&nbsp;&nbsp;D&nbsp;&nbsp;E.
</p>

<p><i>Harsh and untuneful are the notes of love</i>,</p>

<p><i>Unless my</i> Julia <i>strikes the key</i>,</p>

<p><i>Her hand alone can touch the part</i>,</p>

<p><i>Whose dulcet movement charms the heart</i>,</p>

<p><i>And governs all the man with sympathetick sway.</i></p>

<p>
         2d.<br>
<br>
<i>O</i> Julia!</p>

<p>The lines were very natural——for they were nothing
at all to the purpose, says <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, and ’tis a
pity there were no more of them; but whether it was that Seig.
<i>Diego</i> was slow in composing verses—or the hostler
quick in saddling mules——is not averred; certain it
was, that <i>Diego</i>’s mule and <i>Fernandez</i>’s
horse were ready at the door of the inn, before <i>Diego</i> was
ready for his second stanza; so without staying to finish his ode,
they both mounted, sallied forth, passed the <i>Rhine</i>, traversed
<i>Alsace</i>, shaped their course towards <i>Lyons</i>, and before
the <i>Strasburgers</i> and the abbess of <i>Quedlingberg</i> had
set out on their cavalcade, had <i>Fernandez, Diego</i>, and his
<i>Julia</i>, crossed the <i>Pyrenean</i> mountains, and got safe
to <i>Valadolid.</i></p>

<p>’Tis needless to inform the geographical reader, that when
<i>Diego</i> was in <i>Spain</i>, it was not possible to meet the
courteous stranger in the <i>Frankfort</i> road; it is enough to
say, that of all restless desires, curiosity being the
strongest——the <i>Strasburgers</i> felt the full force
of it; and that for three days and nights they were tossed to and
fro in the <i>Frankfort</i> road, with the tempestuous fury of this
passion, before they could submit to return home.——When
alas! an event was prepared for them, of all other, the most
grievous that could befal a free people.</p>

<p>As this revolution of the <i>Strasburgers</i> affairs is often
spoken of, and little understood, I will, in ten words, says
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>, give the world an explanation of it, and with it put an end to my tale.</p>

<p>Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy,
wrote by order of Mons. <i>Colbert</i>, and put in manuscript into
the hands of <i>Lewis</i> the fourteenth, in the year 1664.</p>

<p>’Tis as well known, that one branch out of many of that
system, was the getting possession of <i>Strasburg</i>, to favour
an entrance at all times into <i>Suabia</i>, in order to disturb
the quiet of <i>Germany</i>——and that in consequence of
this plan, <i>Strasburg</i> unhappily fell at length into their
hands.</p>

<p>It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and
such like revolutions—The vulgar look too high for
them—Statesmen look too low——Truth (for once)
lies in the middle.</p>

<p>What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city! cries
one historian—The <i>Strasburgers</i> deemed it a diminution
of their freedom to receive an imperial garrison——so
fell a prey to a <i>French</i> one.</p>

<p>The fate, says another, of the <i>Strasburgers</i>, may be a
warning to all free people to save their money.——They
anticipated their revenues——brought themselves under
taxes, exhausted their strength, and in the end became so weak a
people, they had not strength to keep their gates shut, and so the
<i>French</i> pushed them open.</p>

<p>Alas! alas! cries <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, ’twas not the
<i>French</i>,——’twas <small>CURIOSITY</small>
pushed them open——The <i>French</i> indeed, who are
ever upon the catch, when they saw the <i>Strasburgers</i>, men,
women and children, all marched out to follow the stranger’s
nose——each man followed his own, and marched in.</p>

<p>Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down
ever since—but not from any cause which commercial heads have
assigned; for it is owing to this only, that Noses have ever so run
in their heads, that the <i>Strasburgers</i> could not follow their
business.</p>

<p>Alas! alas! cries <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, making an
exclamation—it is not the first——and I fear will not be the last
fortress that has been either won——or lost by
N<small>OSES</small>.</p>

As <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis</i> is extremely scarce, it may not be
unacceptable to the learned reader to see the specimen of a few pages of his
original; I will make no reflection upon it, but that his story-telling Latin
is much more concise than his philosophic—and, I think, has more of
Latinity in it.

<p>W<small>ITH</small> all this learning upon Noses
running perpetually in my father’s fancy——with so
many family prejudices—and ten decades of such tales running
on for ever along with them——how was it possible with
such exquisite——was it a true nose?——That a
man with such exquisite feelings as my father had, could bear the
shock at all below stairs——or indeed above stairs, in
any other posture, but the very posture I have described?</p>

<p>——Throw yourself down upon the bed, a dozen
times——taking care only to place a looking-glass first
in a chair on one side of it, before you do it—But was the stranger’s nose a true nose, or was it
a false one?</p>

<p>To tell that before-hand, madam, would be to do injury to one of
the best tales in the Christian-world; and that is the tenth of the
tenth decade, which immediately follows this.</p>

<p>This tale, cried <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, somewhat exultingly, has
been reserved by me for the concluding tale of my whole work;
knowing right well, that when I shall have told it, and my reader
shall have read it thro’—’twould be even high
time for both of us to shut up the book; inasmuch, continues
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>, as I know of no tale which could possibly
ever go down after it.</p>

<p>’Tis a tale indeed!</p>

<p>This sets out with the first interview in the inn at
<i>Lyons</i>, when <i>Fernandez</i> left the courteous stranger and
his sister <i>Julia</i> alone in her chamber, and is
over-written.</p>

<i>Diego</i> and <i>Julia.</i>
</p>

<p>Heavens! thou art a strange creature, <i>Slawkenbergius!</i>
what a whimsical view of the involutions of the heart of woman hast
thou opened! how this can ever be translated, and yet if this
specimen of <i>Slawkenbergius</i>’s tales, and the
exquisitiveness of his moral, should please the
world—translated shall a couple of volumes
be.——Else, how this can ever be translated into good
<i>English</i>, I have no sort of conception—There seems in
some passages to want a sixth sense to do it
rightly.——What can he mean by the lambent pupilability
of slow, low, dry chat, five notes below the natural
tone——which you know, madam, is little more than a
whisper? The moment I pronounced the words, I could perceive an
attempt towards a vibration in the strings, about the region of the
heart.——The brain made no
acknowledgment.——There’s often no good
understanding betwixt ’em—I felt as if I understood
it.——I had no ideas.——The movement could
not be without cause.—I’m lost. I can make nothing of
it—unless, may it please your worships, the voice, in that
case being little more than a whisper, unavoidably forces the eyes
to approach not only within six inches of each other—but to
look into the pupils—is not that dangerous?——But
it can’t be avoided—for to look up to the cieling, in
that case the two chins unavoidably meet——and to look
down into each other’s lap, the foreheads come to immediate
contact, which at once puts an end to the conference——I
mean to the sentimental part of it.——What is left,
madam, is not worth stooping for.</p>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father lay stretched across the
bed as still as if the hand of death had pushed him down, for a
full hour and a half before he began to play upon the floor
with the toe of that foot which hung over the bed-side; my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s heart was a pound lighter for
it.——In a few moments, his left-hand, the knuckles of
which had all the time reclined upon the handle of the chamber-pot,
came to its feeling—he thrust it a little more within the
valance—drew up his hand, when he had done, into his
bosom—gave a hem! My good uncle <i>Toby</i>, with infinite
pleasure, answered it; and full gladly would have ingrafted a
sentence of consolation upon the opening it afforded: but having no
talents, as I said, that way, and fearing moreover that he might
set out with something which might make a bad matter worse, he
contented himself with resting his chin placidly upon the cross of
his crutch.</p>

<p>Now whether the compression shortened my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s face into a more pleasurable oval—or that
the philanthropy of his heart, in seeing his brother beginning to
emerge out of the sea of his afflictions, had braced up his
muscles——so that the compression upon his chin only
doubled the benignity which was there before, is not hard to
decide.——My father, in turning his eyes, was struck
with such a gleam of sun-shine in his face, as melted down the
sullenness of his grief in a moment.</p>

<p>He broke silence as follows:</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>D<small>ID</small> ever man, brother <i>Toby</i>,
cried my father, raising himself upon his elbow, and turning
himself round to the opposite side of the bed, where my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was sitting in his old fringed chair, with his chin
resting upon his crutch——did ever a poor unfortunate
man, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, receive so many
lashes?——The most I ever saw given, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i> (ringing the bell at the bed’s head for
<i>Trim</i>) was to a grenadier, I think in <i>Mackay</i>’s
regiment.</p>

<p>——Had my uncle <i>Toby</i> shot a bullet through my father’s heart, he could not
have fallen down with his nose upon the quilt more suddenly.</p>

<p>Bless me! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>AS</small> it <i>Mackay</i>’s
regiment, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, where the poor grenadier was
so unmercifully whipp’d at <i>Bruges</i> about the
ducats?—O Christ! he was innocent! cried <i>Trim</i>, with a
deep sigh.—And he was whipp’d, may it please your
honour, almost to death’s door.—They had better have
shot him outright, as he begg’d, and he had gone directly to
heaven, for he was as innocent as your honour.——I thank
thee, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——I never
think of his, continued <i>Trim</i>, and my poor brother
<i>Tom</i>’s misfortunes, for we were all three
school-fellows, but I cry like a coward.——Tears are no
proof of cowardice, <i>Trim.</i>—I drop them oft-times
myself, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——I know your honour
does, replied <i>Trim</i>, and so am not ashamed of it myself.—But to think, may
it please your honour, continued <i>Trim</i>, a tear stealing into
the corner of his eye as he spoke—to think of two virtuous
lads with hearts as warm in their bodies, and as honest as God
could make them—the children of honest people, going forth
with gallant spirits to seek their fortunes in the world—and
fall into such evils!—poor <i>Tom!</i> to be tortured upon a
rack for nothing—but marrying a Jew’s widow who sold
sausages—honest <i>Dick Johnson</i>’s soul to be
scourged out of his body, for the ducats another man put into his
knapsack!—O!—these are misfortunes, cried
<i>Trim</i>,—pulling out his handkerchief—these are
misfortunes, may it please your honour, worth lying down and crying
over.</p>

<p>—My father could not help blushing.</p>

<p>’Twould be a pity, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, thou shouldst ever feel sorrow of thy own—thou
feelest it so tenderly for others.—Alack-o-day, replied the
corporal, brightening up his face——your honour knows I
have neither wife or child——I can have no sorrows in
this world.——My father could not help smiling.—As
few as any man, <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>; nor can
I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer, but from the
distress of poverty in thy old age—when thou art passed all
services, <i>Trim</i>—and hast outlived thy
friends.——An’ please your honour, never fear,
replied <i>Trim</i>, chearily.——But I would have thee
never fear, <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and
therefore, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, throwing down his
crutch, and getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word
<i>therefore</i>—in recompence, <i>Trim</i>, of thy long
fidelity to me, and that goodness of thy heart I have had such
proofs of—whilst thy master is worth a
shilling——thou shalt never ask elsewhere, <i>Trim</i>,
for a penny. <i>Trim</i> attempted to thank my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—but had not power——tears trickled
down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them off—He laid
his hands upon his breast——made a bow to the ground,
and shut the door.</p>

<p>——I have left <i>Trim</i> my bowling-green, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>——My father smiled.——I
have left him moreover a pension, continued my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.——My father looked grave.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XL</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>S</small> this a fit time, said my father to
himself, to talk of <small>PENSIONS</small> and
<small>GRENADIERS</small>?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLI</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> first
mentioned the grenadier, my father, I said, fell down with his nose
flat to the quilt, and as suddenly as if my uncle <i>Toby</i> had
shot him; but it was not added that every other limb and member of
my father instantly relapsed with his nose into the same precise
attitude in which he lay first described; so that when corporal
<i>Trim</i> left the room, and my father found himself disposed to
rise off the bed—he had all the little preparatory movements to run over again, before he could do it.
Attitudes are nothing, madam——’tis the transition
from one attitude to another——like the preparation and
resolution of the discord into harmony, which is all in all.</p>

<p>For which reason my father played the same jig over again with
his toe upon the floor——pushed the chamber-pot still a
little farther within the valance—gave a hem—raised
himself up upon his elbow—and was just beginning to address
himself to my uncle <i>Toby</i>—when recollecting the
unsuccessfulness of his first effort in that
attitude——he got upon his legs, and in making the third
turn across the room, he stopped short before my uncle <i>Toby</i>;
and laying the three first fingers of his right-hand in the palm of
his left, and stooping a little, he addressed himself to my uncle
<i>Toby</i> as follows:</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> I reflect, brother <i>Toby</i>,
upon <small>MAN</small>; and take a view of that dark side of him
which represents his life as open to so many causes of
trouble—when I consider, brother <i>Toby</i>, how oft we eat
the bread of affliction, and that we are born to it, as to the
portion of our inheritance——I was born to nothing,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, interrupting my father—but my
commission. Zooks! said my father, did not my uncle leave you a
hundred and twenty pounds a year?——What could I have
done without it? replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——That’s another concern, said my
father testily—But I say <i>Toby</i>, when one runs over the
catalogue of all the cross-reckonings and sorrowful <i>Items</i>
with which the heart of man is overcharged, ’tis wonderful by
what hidden resources the mind is enabled to stand out, and bear
itself up, as it does, against the impositions laid upon our nature.——’Tis
by the assistance of Almighty God, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
looking up, and pressing the palms of his hands close
together——’tis not from our own strength, brother
<i>Shandy</i>——a centinel in a wooden centry-box might
as well pretend to stand it out against a detachment of fifty
men.——We are upheld by the grace and the assistance of
the best of Beings.</p>

<p>——That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead
of untying it,——But give me leave to lead you, brother
<i>Toby</i>, a little deeper into the mystery.</p>

<p>With all my heart, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that
in which <i>Socrates</i> is so finely painted by <i>Raffael</i> in
his school of <i>Athens</i>; which your connoisseurship knows is so
exquisitely imagined, that even the particular manner of the
reasoning of <i>Socrates</i> is expressed by it—for he holds
the fore-finger of his left-hand between the fore-finger and the
thumb of his right, and seems as if he was saying to the libertine he is
reclaiming——“<i>You grant me</i>
this——and this: and this, and this, I don’t ask
of you—they follow of themselves in course.”</p>

<p>So stood my father, holding fast his fore-finger betwixt his
finger and his thumb, and reasoning with my uncle <i>Toby</i> as he
sat in his old fringed chair, valanced around with party-coloured
worsted bobs——O <i>Garrick!</i>——what a
rich scene of this would thy exquisite powers make! and how gladly
would I write such another to avail myself of thy immortality, and
secure my own behind it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> man is of all others the most
curious vehicle, said my father, yet at the same time ’tis of
so slight a frame, and so totteringly put together, that the sudden
jerks and hard jostlings it unavoidably meets with in this rugged
journey, would overset and tear it to pieces a dozen times a
day——was it not, brother <i>Toby</i>, that there is a secret
spring within us.—Which spring, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I
take to be Religion.—Will that set my child’s nose on?
cried my father, letting go his finger, and striking one hand
against the other.——It makes every thing straight for
us, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——Figuratively
speaking, dear <i>Toby</i>, it may, for aught I know, said my
father; but the spring I am speaking of, is that great and elastic
power within us of counterbalancing evil, which, like a secret
spring in a well-ordered machine, though it can’t prevent the
shock——at least it imposes upon our sense of it.</p>

<p>Now, my dear brother, said my father, replacing his fore-finger,
as he was coming closer to the point——had my child
arrived safe into the world, unmartyr’d in that precious part
of him—fanciful and extravagant as I may appear to the world
in my opinion of christian names, and of that magic bias which good
or bad names irresistibly impress upon our characters and
conducts—Heaven is witness! that in the warmest transports of my wishes
for the prosperity of my child, I never once wished to crown his
head with more glory and honour than what G<small>EORGE</small> or
E<small>DWARD</small> would have spread around it.</p>

<p>But alas! continued my father, as the greatest evil has befallen
him——I must counteract and undo it with the greatest
good.</p>

<p>He shall be christened <i>Trismegistus</i>, brother.</p>

<p>I wish it may answer——replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
rising up.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HAT</small> a chapter of chances, said my
father, turning himself about upon the first landing, as he and my
uncle <i>Toby</i> were going down stairs, what a long chapter of
chances do the events of this world lay open to us! Take pen and
ink in hand, brother <i>Toby</i>, and calculate it
fairly——I know no more of calculation than this
balluster, said my uncle <i>Toby</i> (striking short of it with his
crutch, and hitting my father a desperate blow souse upon his
shin-bone)——’Twas a hundred to one—cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>—I thought, quoth my father, (rubbing his
shin) you had known nothing of calculations, brother
<i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>a mere chance, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——Then it
adds one to the chapter——replied my father.</p>

<p>The double success of my father’s repartees tickled off
the pain of his shin at once—it was well it so fell
out—(chance! again)—or the world to this day had never
known the subject of my father’s calculation——to
guess it—there was no chance——What a lucky
chapter of chances has this turned out! for it has saved me the
trouble of writing one express, and in truth I have enough already
upon my hands without it.—Have not I promised the world a
chapter of knots? two chapters upon the right and the wrong end of
a woman? a chapter upon whiskers? a chapter upon
wishes?——a chapter of noses?—No, I have done that—a chapter upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s modesty? to say nothing of a chapter upon
chapters, which I will finish before I sleep—by my great
grandfather’s whiskers, I shall never get half of ’em
through this year.</p>

<p>Take pen and ink in hand, and calculate it fairly, brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father, and it will turn out a million to one,
that of all the parts of the body, the edge of the forceps should
have the ill luck just to fall upon and break down that one part,
which should break down the fortunes of our house with it.</p>

<p>It might have been worse, replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.——I don’t comprehend, said my
father.——Suppose the hip had presented, replied my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, as Dr. <i>Slop</i> foreboded.</p>

<p>My father reflected half a minute—looked
down——touched the middle of his forehead slightly with
his finger——</p>

<p>—True, said he.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLV</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>S</small> it not a shame to make two
chapters of what passed in going down one pair of stairs? for we
are got no farther yet than to the first landing, and there are
fifteen more steps down to the bottom; and for aught I know, as my
father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> are in a talking humour, there may
be as many chapters as steps:——let that be as it will,
Sir, I can no more help it than my destiny:—A sudden impulse
comes across me——drop the curtain,
<i>Shandy</i>——I drop it—Strike a line here
across the paper, <i>Tristram</i>—I strike it—and hey
for a new chapter.</p>

<p>The deuce of any other rule have I to govern myself by in this
affair—and if I had one—as I do all things out of all
rule—I would twist it and tear it to pieces, and throw it
into the fire when I had done—Am I warm? I am, and the cause
demands it——a pretty story! is a man to follow rules——or rules to
follow him?</p>

<p>
Now this, you must know, being my chapter upon chapters, which I promised to
write before I went to sleep, I thought it meet to ease my conscience entirely
before I laid down, by telling the world all I knew about the matter at once:
Is not this ten times better than to set out dogmatically with a sententious
parade of wisdom, and telling the world a story of a roasted
horse——that chapters relieve the mind—that they
assist—or impose upon the imagination—and that in a work of this
dramatic cast they are as necessary as the shifting of scenes——with
fifty other cold conceits, enough to extinguish the fire which roasted
him?—O! but to understand this, which is a puff at the fire of
<i>Diana</i>’s temple—you must read <i>Longinus</i>—read
away—if you are not a jot the wiser by reading him the first time
over—never fear—read him again—<i>Avicenna</i> and
<i>Licetus</i> read <i>Aristotle</i>’s metaphysicks forty times through
a-piece, and never understood a single word.—But mark the
consequence—<i>Avicenna</i> turned out a desperate writer at all kinds of
writing—for he wrote books <i>de omni scribili</i>; and for <i>Licetus
(Fortunio)</i> though all the world knows he was born a fœtus,<a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> of no more than five inches and a half
in length, yet he grew to that astonishing height in literature, as to write a
book with a title as long as himself——the learned know I mean his
<i>Gonopsychanthropologia</i>, upon the origin of the human soul.
</p>

<p>So much for my chapter upon chapters, which I hold
to be the best chapter in my whole work; and take my word, whoever
reads it, is full as well employed, as in picking straws.</p>

<p>W<small>E</small> shall bring all things to rights,
said my father, setting his foot upon the first step from the
landing.—This <i>Trismegistus</i>, continued my father,
drawing his leg back and turning to my uncle <i>Toby</i>——was the greatest
(<i>Toby</i>) of all earthly beings—he was the greatest
king——the greatest lawgiver——the greatest
philosopher——and the greatest priest——and
engineer—said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>——In course, said my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVII</small>
</h3>

<p>—A<small>ND</small> how does your mistress?
cried my father, taking the same step over again from the landing,
and calling to <i>Susannah</i>, whom he saw passing by the foot of
the stairs with a huge pin-cushion in her hand—how does your
mistress? As well, said <i>Susannah</i>, tripping by, but without
looking up, as can be expected.—What a fool am I! said my
father, drawing his leg back again—let things be as they
will, brother <i>Toby</i>, ’tis ever the precise
answer——And how is the child, pray?——No
answer. And where is Dr. <i>Slop</i>? added my father, raising his
voice aloud, and looking over the ballusters—<i>Susannah</i>
was out of hearing.</p>

<p>Of all the riddles of a married life, said my father, crossing
the landing in order to set his back against the wall, whilst he
propounded it to my uncle <i>Toby</i>——of all the
puzzling riddles, said he, in a marriage state,——of
which you may trust me, brother <i>Toby</i>, there are more asses
loads than all <i>Job</i>’s stock of asses could have
carried——there is not one that has more intricacies in
it than this—that from the very moment the mistress of the
house is brought to bed, every female in it, from my lady’s
gentlewoman down to the cinder-wench, becomes an inch taller for
it; and give themselves more airs upon that single inch, than all
their other inches put together.</p>

<p>I think rather, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, that ’tis we
who sink an inch lower.—If I meet but a woman with
child—I do it.—’Tis a heavy tax upon that half of
our fellow-creatures, brother <i>Shandy</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—’Tis a piteous burden upon ’em, continued he, shaking his head—Yes,
yes, ’tis a painful thing—said my father, shaking his
head too——but certainly since shaking of heads came
into fashion, never did two heads shake together, in concert, from
two such different springs.</p>

<p>God bless / Deuce take ’em all—said my uncle
<i>Toby</i> and my father, each to himself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVLIII</small>
</h3>

<p>H<small>OLLA</small>!——you,
chairman!——here’s sixpence——do step
into that bookseller’s shop, and call me a day-tall critick.
I am very willing to give any one of ’em a crown to help me
with his tackling, to get my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> off
the stairs, and to put them to bed.</p>

<p>—’Tis even high time; for except a short nap, which
they both got whilst <i>Trim</i> was boring the
jack-boots—and which, by-the-bye, did my father no sort of
good, upon the score of the bad hinge—they have not else shut their eyes, since
nine hours before the time that doctor <i>Slop</i> was led into the
back parlour in that dirty pickle by <i>Obadiah</i>.</p>

<p>Was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this—and
to take up—Truce.</p>

<p>I will not finish that sentence till I have made an observation
upon the strange state of affairs between the reader and myself,
just as things stand at present—an observation never
applicable before to any one biographical writer since the creation
of the world, but to myself—and I believe, will never hold
good to any other, until its final destruction—and therefore,
for the very novelty of it alone, it must be worth your worships
attending to.</p>

<p>
I am this month one whole year older than I was this time twelve-month; and
having got, as you perceive, almost into the middle of my third volume<a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>—and no farther than to my first
day’s life—’tis demonstrative that I have three hundred and
sixty-four days more life to write just now, than when I first set out; so that
instead of advancing, as a common writer, in my work with what I have been
doing at it—on the contrary, I am just thrown so many volumes
back—was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this—And why
not?——and the transactions and opinions of it to take up as much
description—And for what reason should they be cut short? as at this rate
I should just live 364 times faster than I should write—It must follow,
an’ please your worships, that the more I write, the more I shall have to
write—and consequently, the more your worships read, the more your
worships will have to read.
</p>

<p>Will this be good for your worships eyes?</p>

<p>It will do well for mine; and, was it not that my
O<small>PINIONS</small> will be the death of me, I perceive I shall
lead a fine life of it out of this self-same life of mine; or, in
other words, shall lead a couple of fine lives together.</p>

<p>As for the proposal of twelve volumes a year, or a volume a month, it no way alters my
prospect—write as I will, and rush as I may into the middle
of things, as <i>Horace</i> advises—I shall never overtake
myself whipp’d and driven to the last pinch; at the worst I
shall have one day the start of my pen—and one day is enough
for two volumes——and two volumes will be enough for one
year.—</p>

<p>Heaven prosper the manufacturers of paper under this propitious
reign, which is now opened to us——as I trust its
providence will prosper every thing else in it that is taken in
hand.</p>

<p>As for the propagation of Geese—I give myself no
concern—Nature is all-bountiful—I shall never want
tools to work with.</p>

<p>—So then, friend! you have got my father and my uncle
<i>Toby</i> off the stairs, and seen them to bed?——And
how did you manage it?——You dropp’d a curtain at
the stair-foot—I thought you had no other way for
it——Here’s a crown for your trouble.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIX</small>
</h3>

<p>—T<small>HEN</small> reach me my breeches off
the chair, said my father to <i>Susannah.</i>—There is not a
moment’s time to dress you, Sir, cried
<i>Susannah</i>—the child is as black in the face as
my——As your what? said my father, for like all orators,
he was a dear searcher into comparisons.—Bless, me, Sir, said
<i>Susannah</i>, the child’s in a fit.—And
where’s Mr. <i>Yorick?</i>—Never where he should be,
said <i>Susannah</i>, but his curate’s in the dressing-room,
with the child upon his arm, waiting for the name—and my
mistress bid me run as fast as I could to know, as captain
<i>Shandy</i> is the godfather, whether it should not be called
after him.</p>

<p>Were one sure, said my father to himself, scratching his
eye-brow, that the child was expiring, one might as well compliment
my brother <i>Toby</i> as not—and it would be a pity, in
such a case, to throw away so great a name as <i>Trismegistus</i> upon him——but he may
recover.</p>

<p>No, no,——said my father to <i>Susannah</i>,
I’ll get up——There is no time, cried
<i>Susannah</i>, the child’s as black as my shoe.
<i>Trismegistus</i>, said my father——But
stay—thou art a leaky vessel, <i>Susannah</i>, added my
father; canst thou carry <i>Trismegistus</i> in thy head, the
length of the gallery without scattering?——Can I? cried
<i>Susannah</i>, shutting the door in a huff.——If she
can, I’ll be shot, said my father, bouncing out of bed in the
dark, and groping for his breeches.</p>

<p><i>Susannah</i> ran with all speed along the gallery.</p>

<p>My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.</p>

<p><i>Susannah</i> got the start, and kept it—’Tis
<i>Tris</i>—something, cried <i>Susannah</i>—There is
no christian-name in the world, said the curate, beginning with
<i>Tris</i>—but <i>Tristram.</i> Then ’tis
<i>Tristram-gistus</i>, quoth <i>Susannah.</i></p>

<p>——There is no <i>gistus</i> to it, noodle!—’tis my own name, replied the curate,
dipping his hand, as he spoke, into the
bason—<i>Tristram!</i> said he, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c.—so <i>Tristram</i> was I called, and <i>Tristram</i>
shall I be to the day of my death.</p>

<p>My father followed <i>Susannah</i>, with his night-gown across
his arm, with nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through
haste with but a single button, and that button through haste
thrust only half into the button-hole.</p>

<p>——She has not forgot the name, cried my father, half
opening the door?——No, no, said the curate, with a tone
of intelligence.——And the child is better, cried
<i>Susannah.</i>——And how does your mistress? As well,
said <i>Susannah</i>, as can be expected.—Pish! said my
father, the button of his breeches slipping out of the
button-hole—So that whether the interjection was levelled at
<i>Susannah</i>, or the button-hole—whether Pish was an
interjection of contempt or an interjection of modesty, is a doubt,
and must be a doubt till I shall have time to write the three following favourite
chapters, that is, my chapter of <i>chamber-maids</i>, my chapter
of <i>pishes</i>, and my chapter of <i>button-holes.</i></p>

<p>All the light I am able to give the reader at present is this,
that the moment my father cried Pish! he whisk’d himself
about—and with his breeches held up by one hand, and his
night-gown thrown across the arm of the other, he turned along the
gallery to bed, something slower than he came.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;L</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>WISH</small> I could write a chapter upon
sleep.</p>

<p>A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what
this moment offers, when all the curtains of the family are
drawn—the candles put out—and no creature’s eyes
are open but a single one, for the other has been shut these twenty
years, of my mother’s nurse.</p>

<p>It is a fine subject.</p>

<p>And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon
button-holes, both quicker and with more fame, than a single
chapter upon this.</p>

<p>Button-holes! there is something lively in the very idea of
’em——and trust me, when I get amongst
’em——You gentry with great
beards——look as grave as you
will——I’ll make merry work with my
button-holes—I shall have ’em all to
myself—’tis a maiden subject—I shall run foul of
no man’s wisdom or fine sayings in it.</p>

<p>But for sleep—I know I shall make nothing of it before I
begin—I am no dab at your fine sayings in the first
place—and in the next, I cannot for my soul set a grave face
upon a bad matter, and tell the world—’tis the refuge
of the unfortunate—the enfranchisement of the
prisoner—the downy lap of the hopeless, the weary, and the
broken-hearted; nor could I set out with a lye in my mouth, by
affirming, that of all the soft and delicious functions of our
nature, by which the great Author of it, in his bounty, has been pleased to recompence the sufferings
wherewith his justice and his good pleasure has wearied
us——that this is the chiefest (I know pleasures worth
ten of it); or what a happiness it is to man, when the anxieties
and passions of the day are over, and he lies down upon his back,
that his soul shall be so seated within him, that whichever way she
turns her eyes, the heavens shall look calm and sweet above
her—no desire—or fear—or doubt that troubles the
air, nor any difficulty past, present, or to come, that the
imagination may not pass over without offence, in that sweet
secession.</p>

<p>“God’s blessing,” said <i>Sancho
Pança</i>, “be upon the man who first invented
this self-same thing called sleep—it covers a man all over
like a cloak.”</p>

<p>Now there is more to me in this, and it speaks warmer to my
heart and affections, than all the dissertations squeez’d out
of the heads of the learned together upon the subject.</p>

<p>—Not that I altogether disapprove of what <i>Montaigne</i> advances upon
it—’tis admirable in its way—(I quote by
memory.)</p>

<p>The world enjoys other pleasures, says he, as they do that of
sleep, without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes
by.—We should study and ruminate upon it, in order to render
proper thanks to him who grants it to us.—For this end I
cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, that I may the better and
more sensibly relish it.——And yet I see few, says he
again, who live with less sleep, when need requires; my body is
capable of a firm, but not of a violent and sudden
agitation—I evade of late all violent
exercises——I am never weary with
walking——but from my youth, I never looked to ride upon
pavements. I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my
wife——This last word may stagger the faith of the
world——but remember, “La
Vraisemblance’ (as <i>Bayle</i> says in the affair of
<i>Liceti</i>) ’est pas toujours du Côté de la
Verité.” And so much for sleep.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LI</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>F</small> my wife will but venture
him—brother <i>Toby, Trismegistus</i> shall be dress’d
and brought down to us, whilst you and I are getting our breakfasts
together.——</p>

<p>——Go, tell <i>Susannah, Obadiah</i>, to step
here.</p>

<p>She is run up stairs, answered <i>Obadiah</i>, this very
instant, sobbing and crying, and wringing her hands as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>We shall have a rare month of it, said my father, turning his
head from <i>Obadiah</i>, and looking wistfully in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s face for some time—we shall have a
devilish month of it, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, setting
his arms a’kimbo, and shaking his head; fire, water, women,
wind—brother <i>Toby</i>!—’Tis some misfortune,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——That it is, cried my
father—to have so many jarring elements breaking loose, and
riding triumph in every corner of a gentleman’s house—Little boots it to the peace
of a family, brother <i>Toby</i>, that you and I possess ourselves,
and sit here silent and unmoved——whilst such a storm is
whistling over our heads.——</p>

<p>And what’s the matter, <i>Susannah?</i> They have called
the child <i>Tristram</i>——and my mistress is just got
out of an hysterick fit about
it——No!——’tis not my fault, said
<i>Susannah</i>—I told him it was <i>Tristram-gistus.</i></p>

<p>——Make tea for yourself, brother <i>Toby</i>, said
my father, taking down his hat——but how different from
the sallies and agitations of voice and members which a common
reader would imagine!</p>

<p>—For he spake in the sweetest modulation—and took
down his hat with the genteelest movement of limbs, that ever
affliction harmonized and attuned together.</p>

<p>——Go to the bowling-green for corporal <i>Trim</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, speaking to <i>Obadiah</i>, as soon as
my father left the room.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> the misfortune of my Nose fell
so heavily upon my father’s head;—the reader remembers
that he walked instantly up stairs, and cast himself down upon his
bed; and from hence, unless he has a great insight into human
nature, he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same ascending
and descending movements from him, upon this misfortune of my
N<small>AME</small>;—no.</p>

<p>The different weight, dear Sir——nay even the
different package of two vexations of the same
weight——makes a very wide difference in our manner of
bearing and getting through with them.——It is not half
an hour ago, when (in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor
devil’s writing for daily bread) I threw a fair sheet, which
I had just finished, and carefully wrote out, slap into the fire,
instead of the foul one.</p>

<p>Instantly I snatch’d off my wig, and threw it
perpendicularly, with all imaginable violence, up to the top of the
room—indeed I caught it as it fell——but there was
an end of the matter; nor do I think any think else in
<i>Nature</i> would have given such immediate ease: She, dear
Goddess, by an instantaneous impulse, in all <i>provoking
cases</i>, determines us to a sally of this or that member—or
else she thrusts us into this or that place, or posture of body, we
know not why——But mark, madam, we live amongst riddles
and mysteries——the most obvious things, which come in
our way, have dark sides, which the quickest sight cannot penetrate
into; and even the clearest and most exalted understandings amongst
us find ourselves puzzled and at a loss in almost every cranny of
nature’s works: so that this, like a thousand other things,
falls out for us in a way, which tho’ we cannot reason upon
it—yet we find the good of it, may it please your reverences
and your worships——and that’s enough for us.</p>

<p>Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his
life——nor could he carry it up stairs like the other—he
walked composedly out with it to the fish-pond.</p>

<p>Had my father leaned his head upon his hand, and reasoned an
hour which way to have gone——reason, with all her
force, could not have directed him to any think like it: there is
something, Sir, in fish-ponds——but what it is, I leave
to system-builders and fish-pond-diggers betwixt ’em to find
out—but there is something, under the first disorderly
transport of the humours, so unaccountably becalming in an orderly
and a sober walk towards one of them, that I have often wondered
that neither <i>Pythagoras</i>, nor <i>Plato</i>, nor <i>Solon</i>,
nor <i>Lycurgus</i>, nor <i>Mahomet</i>, nor any one of your noted
lawgivers, ever gave order about them.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

<p>Y<small>OUR</small> honour, said <i>Trim</i>,
shutting the parlour-door before he began to speak, has heard, I
imagine, of this unlucky accident——O yes,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and it gives me great
concern.—I am heartily concerned too, but I hope your honour,
replied <i>Trim</i>, will do me the justice to believe, that it was
not in the least owing to me.——To
thee—<i>Trim?</i>—cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking
kindly in his face——’twas <i>Susannah</i>’s
and the curate’s folly betwixt them.——What
business could they have together, an’ please your honour, in
the garden?——In the gallery thou meanest, replied my
uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>Trim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a
low bow——Two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to
himself, are twice as many at least as are needful to be talked
over at one time;——the mischief the cow has done in
breaking into the fortifications, may be told his honour
hereafter.——<i>Trim</i>’s casuistry and address,
under the cover of his low bow, prevented all suspicion in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, so he went on with what he had to say to <i>Trim</i>
as follows:</p>

<p>——For my own part, <i>Trim</i>, though I can see
little or no difference betwixt my nephew’s being called <i>Tristram</i> or
<i>Trismegistus</i>—yet as the thing sits so near my
brother’s heart, <i>Trim</i>——I would freely have
given a hundred pounds rather than it should have
happened.——A hundred pounds, an’ please your
honour! replied <i>Trim</i>,—I would not give a cherry-stone
to boot.——Nor would I, <i>Trim</i>, upon my own
account, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>——but my brother,
whom there is no arguing with in this case—maintains that a
great deal more depends, <i>Trim</i>, upon christian-names, than
what ignorant people imagine——for he says there never
was a great or heroic action performed since the world began by one
called <i>Tristram</i>—nay, he will have it, <i>Trim</i>,
that a man can neither be learned, or wise, or
brave.——’Tis all fancy, an’ please your
honour—I fought just as well, replied the corporal, when the
regiment called me <i>Trim</i>, as when they called me <i>James
Butler.</i>——And for my own part, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, though I should blush to boast of myself,
<i>Trim</i>——yet had my name been <i>Alexander</i>, I could have done no more at
<i>Namur</i> than my duty.—Bless your honour! cried
<i>Trim</i>, advancing three steps as he spoke, does a man think of
his christian-name when he goes upon the attack?——Or
when he stands in the trench, <i>Trim?</i> cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, looking firm.——Or when he enters a breach?
said <i>Trim</i>, pushing in between two chairs.——Or
forces the lines? cried my uncle, rising up, and pushing his crutch
like a pike.——Or facing a platoon? cried <i>Trim</i>,
presenting his stick like a firelock.——Or when he
marches up the glacis? cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking warm and
setting his foot upon his stool.——</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIV</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father was returned from his walk
to the fish-pond——and opened the parlour-door in the
very height of the attack, just as my uncle <i>Toby</i> was
marching up the glacis——<i>Trim</i> recovered his
arms——never was my uncle <i>Toby</i> caught in riding at such a
desperate rate in his life! Alas! my uncle <i>Toby!</i> had not a
weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence of my
father—how hadst thou then and thy poor
H<small>OBBY</small>-H<small>ORSE</small> too been insulted!</p>

<p>My father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down; and
after giving a slight look at the disorder of the room, he took
hold of one of the chairs which had formed the corporal’s
breach, and placing it over-against my uncle <i>Toby</i>, he sat
down in it, and as soon as the tea-things were taken away, and the
door shut, he broke out in a lamentation as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
M<small>Y</small> F<small>ATHER'S</small>
L<small>AMENTATION</small>
</p>

<p>I<small>T</small> is in vain longer, said my father, addressing
himself as much to <i>Ernulphus</i>’s curse, which was laid
upon the corner of the chimney-piece——as to my uncle
<i>Toby</i> who sat under it——it is in vain longer,
said my father, in the most querulous monotony imaginable, to struggle as I
have done against this most uncomfortable of human
persuasions——I see it plainly, that either for my own
sins, brother <i>Toby</i>, or the sins and follies of the
<i>Shandy</i> family, Heaven has thought fit to draw forth the
heaviest of its artillery against me; and that the prosperity of my
child is the point upon which the whole force of it is directed to
play.——Such a thing would batter the whole universe
about our ears, brother <i>Shandy</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—if it was so—Unhappy <i>Tristram!</i> child
of wrath! child of decrepitude! interruption! mistake! and
discontent! What one misfortune or disaster in the book of
embryotic evils, that could unmechanize thy frame, or entangle thy
filaments! which has not fallen upon thy head, or ever thou camest
into the world——what evils in thy passage into
it!——what evils since!——produced into
being, in the decline of thy father’s days——when
the powers of his imagination and of his body were waxing feeble——when radical heat and radical
moisture, the elements which should have temper’d thine, were
drying up; and nothing left to found thy stamina in, but
negations—’tis pitiful——brother
<i>Toby</i>, at the best, and called out for all the little helps
that care and attention on both sides could give it. But how were
we defeated! You know the event, brother
<i>Toby</i>——’tis too melancholy a one to be
repeated now——when the few animal spirits I was worth
in the world, and with which memory, fancy, and quick parts should
have been convey’d——were all dispersed, confused,
confounded, scattered, and sent to the devil.——</p>

<p>Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution
against him;——and tried an experiment at
least——whether calmness and serenity of mind in your
sister, with a due attention, brother <i>Toby</i>, to her
evacuations and repletions——and the rest of her
non-naturals, might not, in a course of nine months gestation, have
set all things to rights.——My child was bereft of
these!——What a teazing life did she lead herself, and
consequently her fœtus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of
hers about lying-in in town? I thought my sister submitted with the
greatest patience, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>——I
never heard her utter one fretful word about it.——She
fumed inwardly, cried my father; and that, let me tell you,
brother, was ten times worse for the child—and then! what
battles did she fight with me, and what perpetual storms about the
midwife.——There she gave vent, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.——Vent! cried my father, looking up.</p>

<p>But what was all this, my dear <i>Toby</i>, to the injuries done
us by my child’s coming head foremost into the world, when
all I wished, in this general wreck of his frame, was to have saved
this little casket unbroke, unrifled.——</p>

<p>With all my precautions, how was my system turned topside-turvy
in the womb with my child! his head exposed to the hand of
violence, and a pressure of 470 pounds avoirdupois weight acting so perpendicularly
upon its apex—that at this hour ’tis ninety <i>per
Cent.</i> insurance, that the fine net-work of the intellectual web
be not rent and torn to a thousand tatters.</p>

<p>——Still we could have done.——Fool,
coxcomb, puppy——give him but a
N<small>OSE</small>——Cripple, Dwarf, Driveller,
Goosecap——shape him as you will) the door of fortune
stands open—<i>O Licetus! Licetus!</i> had I been blest with
a fœtus five inches long and a half, like thee—Fate
might have done her worst.</p>

<p>Still, brother <i>Toby</i>, there was one cast of the dye left
for our child after all—<i>O Tristram! Tristram!
Tristram!</i></p>

<p>We will send for Mr. <i>Yorick</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>——You may send for whom you will, replied my
father.</p>

looking once behind, or even on one side of me, to see whom I trod
upon!—I’ll tread upon no one——quoth I to myself when I
mounted——I’ll take a good rattling gallop; but I’ll not
hurt the poorest jack-ass upon the road.——So off I
set——up one lane——down another, through this

you’ve splash’d a bishop——I hope in God,

have squirted full in the faces of Mess. <i>Le Moyne, De

I.—But you have trod this moment upon a

<p>You have done it, replied my accuser.</p>

<p>
A<small>S</small> <i>Francis</i> the first of <i>France</i> was one winterly
night warming himself over the embers of a wood fire, and talking with his
first minister of sundry things for the good of the state<a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>—It would
not be amiss, said the king, stirring up the embers with his cane, if this good
understanding betwixt ourselves and <i>Switzerland</i> was a little
strengthened.—There is no end, Sire, replied the minister, in giving
money to these people—they would swallow up the treasury of
<i>France.</i>—Poo! poo! answered the king—there are more ways,
Mons. <i>le Premier</i>, of bribing states, besides that of giving
money—I’ll pay <i>Switzerland</i> the honour of standing godfather
for my next child.——Your majesty, said the minister, in so doing,
would have all the grammarians in <i>Europe</i> upon your
back;——<i>Switzerland</i>, as a republic, being a female, can in no
construction be godfather.—She may be godmother, replied <i>Francis</i>
hastily—so announce my intentions by a courier to-morrow morning.
</p>

<p>I am astonished, said <i>Francis</i> the First, (that day
fortnight) speaking to his minister as he entered the closet, that
we have had no answer from <i>Switzerland.</i>——Sire, I
wait upon you this moment, said Mons. <i>le Premier</i>, to lay
before you my dispatches upon that business.—They take it
kindly, said the king.—They do, Sire, replied the minister,
and have the highest sense of the honour your majesty has done
them——but the republick, as godmother, claims her
right, in this case, of naming the child.</p>

<p>In all reason, quoth the king—she will christen him
<i>Francis</i>, or <i>Henry</i>, or <i>Lewis</i>, or some name that
she knows will be agreeable to us. Your majesty is deceived,
replied the minister——I have this hour received a
dispatch from our resident, with the determination of the republic
on that point also.——And what name has the republick
fixed upon for the Dauphin?——<i>Shadrach, Mesech, Abed-nego</i>, replied the
minister.—By Saint <i>Peter</i>’s girdle, I will have
nothing to do with the <i>Swiss</i>, cried <i>Francis</i> the
First, pulling up his breeches and walking hastily across the
floor.</p>

<p>Your majesty, replied the minister calmly, cannot bring yourself
off.</p>

<p>We’ll pay them in money——said the king.</p>

<p>Sire, there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury,
answered the minister.——I’ll pawn the best jewel
in my crown, quoth <i>Francis</i> the First.</p>

<p>Your honour stands pawn’d already in this matter, answered
Monsieur <i>le Premier.</i></p>

<p>Then, Mons. <i>le Premier</i>, said the king,
by——we’ll go to war with ’em.</p>

</h3>

<p>A<small>LBEIT</small>, gentle reader, I have lusted
earnestly, and endeavoured carefully (according to the measure of
such a slender skill as God has vouchsafed me, and as convenient
leisure from other occasions of needful profit and healthful
pastime have permitted) that these little books which I here put
into thy hands, might stand instead of many bigger books—yet
have I carried myself towards thee in such fanciful guise of
careless disport, that right sore am I ashamed now to intreat thy
lenity seriously——in beseeching thee to believe it of
me, that in the story of my father and his christian-names—I
have no thoughts of treading upon <i>Francis</i> the
First——nor in the affair of the nose—upon
<i>Francis</i> the Ninth—nor in the character of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——of characterizing the militiating spirits
of my country—the wound upon his groin, is a wound to every
comparison of that kind—nor by <i>Trim</i>—that I meant
the duke of <i>Ormond</i>—or that my book is wrote against
predestination, or free-will, or taxes—If ’tis wrote
against any thing,——’tis wrote, an’ please
your worships, against the spleen! in order, by a more frequent and
a more convulsive elevation and depression of the diaphragm, and
the succussations of the intercostal and abdominal muscles
in laughter, to drive the <i>gall</i> and other <i>bitter
juices</i> from the gall-bladder, liver, and sweet-bread of his
majesty’s subjects, with all the inimicitious passions which
belong to them, down into their duodenums.</p>

<p>—B<small>UT</small> can the thing be undone,
<i>Yorick?</i> said my father—for in my opinion, continued
he, it cannot. I am a vile canonist, replied
<i>Yorick</i>—but of all evils, holding suspence to be the
most tormenting, we shall at least know the worst of this matter. I
hate these great dinners——said my father—The size
of the dinner is not the point, answered
<i>Yorick</i>——we want, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, to dive into
the bottom of this doubt, whether the name can be changed or
not—and as the beards of so many commissaries, officials,
advocates, proctors, registers, and of the most eminent of our
school-divines, and others, are all to meet in the middle of one table, and <i>Didius</i> has so
pressingly invited you—who in your distress would miss such
an occasion? All that is requisite, continued <i>Yorick</i>, is to
apprize <i>Didius</i>, and let him manage a conversation after
dinner so as to introduce the subject.—Then my brother
<i>Toby</i>, cried my father, clapping his two hands together,
shall go with us.</p>

<p>——Let my old tye-wig, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
and my laced regimentals, be hung to the fire all night,
<i>Trim.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LX</small>
</h3>

<p>—N<small>O</small> doubt, Sir,—there is
a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in
the book by it—but the book-binder is neither a fool, or a
knave, or a puppy—nor is the book a jot more imperfect (at
least upon that score)——but, on the contrary, the book
is more perfect and complete by wanting the chapter, than having
it, as I shall demonstrate to your reverences in this
manner.—I question first, by-the-bye, whether the same
experiment might not be made as successfully upon sundry other
chapters——but there is no end, an’ please your
reverences, in trying experiments upon chapters——we
have had enough of it——So there’s an end of that
matter.</p>

<p>But before I begin my demonstration, let me only
tell you, that the chapter which I have torn out, and which
otherwise you would all have been reading just now, instead of
this——was the description of my father’s, my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s, <i>Trim</i>’s, and
<i>Obadiah</i>’s setting out and journeying to the visitation
at ****</p>

<p>We’ll go in the coach, said my father—Prithee, have
the arms been altered, <i>Obadiah</i>?—It would have made my
story much better to have begun with telling you, that at the time
my mother’s arms were added to the <i>Shandy</i>’s,
when the coach was re-painted upon my father’s marriage, it
had so fallen out that the coach-painter, whether by performing all
his works with the left hand, like <i>Turpilius</i> the
<i>Roman</i>, or <i>Hans Holbein</i> of
<i>Basil</i>——or whether ’twas more from the
blunder of his head than hand——or whether, lastly, it
was from the sinister turn which every thing relating to our family
was apt to take——it so fell out, however, to our
reproach, that instead of the <i>bend-dexter</i>, which since
<i>Harry</i> the Eighth’s reign was honestly our
due——a <i>bend-sinister</i>, by some of these
fatalities, had been drawn quite across the field of the
<i>Shandy</i> arms. ’Tis scarce credible that the mind of so
wise a man as my father was, could be so much incommoded with so
small a matter. The word coach—let it be whose it
would—or coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could
never be named in the family, but he constantly complained of
carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his own;
he never once was able to step into the coach, or out of it,
without turning round to take a view of the arms, and making a vow
at the same time, that it was the last time he would ever set his
foot in it again, till the <i>bend-sinister</i> was taken
out—but like the affair of the hinge, it was one of the many
things which the <i>Destinies</i> had set down in their books ever
to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)—but never
to be mended.</p>

<p>—Has the <i>bend-sinister</i> been brush’d out, I
say? said my father.——There has been nothing brush’d out, Sir, answered
<i>Obadiah</i>, but the lining. We’ll go o’horseback,
said my father, turning to <i>Yorick</i>—Of all things in the
world, except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry,
said <i>Yorick.</i>—No matter for that, cried my
father——I should be sorry to appear with a blot in my
escutcheon before them.—Never mind the <i>bend-sinister</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, putting on his tye-wig.——No,
indeed, said my father—you may go with my aunt <i>Dinah</i>
to a visitation with a <i>bend-sinister</i>, if you think
fit—My poor uncle <i>Toby</i> blush’d. My father was
vexed at himself.——No——my dear brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father, changing his tone——but the
damp of the coach-lining about my loins, may give me the sciatica
again, as it did <i>December, January</i>, and <i>February</i> last
winter—so if you please you shall ride my wife’s
pad——and as you are to preach, <i>Yorick</i>, you had
better make the best of your way before——and leave me
to take care of my brother <i>Toby</i>, and to follow at our own
rates.</p>

<p>Now the chapter I was obliged to tear out, was the description
of this cavalcade, in which Corporal <i>Trim</i> and
<i>Obadiah</i>, upon two coach-horses a-breast, led the way as slow
as a patrole——whilst my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in his laced
regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep
roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning
and arms, as each could get the start.</p>

<p>—But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it,
appears to be so much above the stile and manner of any thing else
I have been able to paint in this book, that it could not have
remained in it, without depreciating every other scene; and
destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise and balance,
(whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from whence
the just proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my
own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little
about it—but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the
world like humming a song—be but in tune with yourself,
madam, ’tis no matter how high or how low you take it.</p>

<p>—This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that
some of the lowest and flattest compositions pass off very
well——(as <i>Yorick</i> told my uncle <i>Toby</i> one
night) by siege.——My uncle <i>Toby</i> looked brisk at
the sound of the word siege, but could make neither head or tail of
it.</p>

<p>I’m to preach at court next Sunday, said
<i>Homenas</i>——run over my notes——so I
humm’d over doctor <i>Homenas</i>’s notes—the
modulation’s very well—’twill do, <i>Homenas</i>,
if it holds on at this rate——so on I
humm’d——and a tolerable tune I thought it was;
and to this hour, may it please your reverences, had never found
out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but that
all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it, so fine, so
rich, so heavenly,—it carried my soul up with it into the
other world; now had I (as <i>Montaigne</i> complained in a
parallel accident)—had I found the declivity easy, or the ascent
accessible——certes I had been
outwitted.——Your notes, <i>Homenas</i>, I should have
said, are good notes;——but it was so perpendicular a
precipice——so wholly cut off from the rest of the work,
that by the first note I humm’d I found myself flying into
the other world, and from thence discovered the vale from whence I
came, so deep, so low, and dismal, that I shall never have the
heart to descend into it again.</p>

<p>=&gt;A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his
own size—take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than
one.—And so much for tearing out of chapters.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXI</small>
</h3>

<p>——S<small>EE</small> if he is not
cutting it into slips, and giving them about him to light their
pipes!——’Tis abominable, answered <i>Didius;</i>
it should not go unnoticed, said doctor
<i>Kysarcius</i>—— =&gt; he was of the <i>Kysarcii</i>
of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Methinks, said <i>Didius</i>, half rising from his chair, in
order to remove a bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a
direct line betwixt him and <i>Yorick</i>——you might
have spared this sarcastic stroke, and have hit upon a more proper
place, Mr. <i>Yorick</i>—or at least upon a more proper
occasion to have shewn your contempt of what we have been about: If
the sermon is of no better worth than to light pipes
with——’twas certainly, Sir, not good enough to be
preached before so learned a body; and if ’twas good enough
to be preached before so learned a body——’twas
certainly Sir, too good to light their pipes with afterwards.</p>

<p>——I have got him fast hung up, quoth <i>Didius</i>
to himself, upon one of the two horns of my
dilemma——let him get off as he can.</p>

<p>I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth
this sermon, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, upon this
occasion——that I declare, <i>Didius</i>, I would suffer
martyrdom—and if it was possible my horse with me, a thousand times over, before I would
sit down and make such another: I was delivered of it at the wrong
end of me——it came from my head instead of my
heart——and it is for the pain it gave me, both in the
writing and preaching of it, that I revenge myself of it, in this
manner—To preach, to shew the extent of our reading, or the
subtleties of our wit—to parade in the eyes of the vulgar
with the beggarly accounts of a little learning, tinsel’d
over with a few words which glitter, but convey little light and
less warmth——is a dishonest use of the poor single half
hour in a week which is put into our hands—’Tis not
preaching the gospel—but ourselves——For my own
part, continued <i>Yorick</i>, I had rather direct five words
point-blank to the heart.—</p>

<p>As <i>Yorick</i> pronounced the word <i>point-blank</i>, my
uncle <i>Toby</i> rose up to say something upon
projectiles——when a single word and no more uttered
from the opposite side of the table drew every one’s ears towards it—a word of all
others in the dictionary the last in that place to be
expected—a word I am ashamed to write—yet must be
written——must be
read—illegal—uncanonical—guess ten thousand
guesses, multiplied into themselves—rack—torture your
invention for ever, you’re where you was——In
short, I’ll tell it in the next chapter.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXII</small>
</h3>

<p>
Z<small>OUNDS</small>!————————————————————————Z——ds!
cried <i>Phutatorius</i>, partly to himself——and yet high enough to
be heard—and what seemed odd, ’twas uttered in a construction of
look, and in a tone of voice, somewhat between that of a man in amazement and
one in bodily pain.
</p>

<p>One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the
expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a
<i>third</i> or a <i>fifth</i>, or any other chord in musick—were the most puzzled and perplexed
with it—the concord was good in itself—but then
’twas quite out of the key, and no way applicable to the
subject started;——so that with all their knowledge,
they could not tell what in the world to make of it.</p>

<p>Others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent
their ears to the plain import of the <i>word</i>, imagined that
<i>Phutatorius</i>, who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was
just going to snatch the cudgels out of <i>Didius</i>’s
hands, in order to bemaul <i>Yorick</i> to some purpose—and
that the desperate monosyllable Z——ds was the exordium
to an oration, which, as they judged from the sample, presaged but
a rough kind of handling of him; so that my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s good-nature felt a pang for what <i>Yorick</i>
was about to undergo. But seeing <i>Phutatorius</i> stop short,
without any attempt or desire to go on—a third party began to
suppose, that it was no more than an involuntary respiration,
casually forming itself into the shape of a twelve-penny oath—without the sin or substance of one.</p>

<p>Others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked upon
it on the contrary as a real and substantial oath, propensly formed
against <i>Yorick</i>, to whom he was known to bear no good
liking—which said oath, as my father philosophized upon it,
actually lay fretting and fuming at that very time in the upper
regions of <i>Phutatorius</i>’s purtenance; and so was
naturally, and according to the due course of things, first
squeezed out by the sudden influx of blood which was driven into
the right ventricle of <i>Phutatorius</i>’s heart, by the
stroke of surprize which so strange a theory of preaching had
excited.</p>

<p>How finely we argue upon mistaken facts!</p>

<p>There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon
the monosyllable which <i>Phutatorius</i> uttered—who did not
take this for granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely,
that <i>Phutatorius</i>’s mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
<i>Didius</i> and <i>Yorick;</i> and indeed as he looked first
towards the one and then towards the other, with the air of a man
listening to what was going forwards—who would not have
thought the same? But the truth was, that <i>Phutatorius</i> knew
not one word or one syllable of what was passing—but his
whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which
was going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his
own <i>Galligaskins</i>, and in a part of them, where of all others
he stood most interested to watch accidents: So that
notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world, and
had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to the
utmost pitch the instrument would bear, in order, as it was
thought, to give a sharp reply to <i>Yorick</i>, who sat
over-against him——yet, I say, was <i>Yorick</i> never
once in any one domicile of <i>Phutatorius</i>’s
brain——but the true cause of his exclamation lay at
least a yard below.</p>

<p>This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable
decency.</p>

<p>You must be informed then, that <i>Gastripheres</i>, who had
taken a turn into the kitchen a little before dinner, to see how
things went on—observing a wicker-basket of fine chesnuts
standing upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of
them might be roasted and sent in, as soon as dinner was
over—&nbsp;<i>Gastripheres</i> inforcing his orders about
them, that <i>Didius</i>, but <i>Phutatorius</i> especially, were
particularly fond of ’em.</p>

<p>About two minutes before the time that my uncle <i>Toby</i>
interrupted <i>Yorick</i>’s
harangue—<i>Gastripheres</i>’s chesnuts were brought
in—and as <i>Phutatorius</i>’s fondness for ’em
was uppermost in the waiter’s head, he laid them directly
before <i>Phutatorius</i>, wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.</p>

<p>Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen
hands all thrust into the napkin at a time—but that some one
chesnut, of more life and rotundity than the rest, must be put in
motion—it so fell out, however, that one was actually sent
rolling off the table; and as <i>Phutatorius</i> sat straddling
under——it fell perpendicularly into that particular
aperture of <i>Phutatorius</i>’s breeches, for which, to the
shame and indelicacy of our language be it spoke, there is no
chaste word throughout all <i>Johnson</i>’s
dictionary——let it suffice to say——it was
that particular aperture which, in all good societies, the laws of
decorum do strictly require, like the temple of <i>Janus</i> (in
peace at least) to be universally shut up.</p>

<p>The neglect of this punctilio in <i>Phutatorius</i> (which
by-the-bye should be a warning to all mankind) had opened a door to
this accident.——</p>

<p>Accident I call it, in compliance to a received mode of
speaking——but in no opposition to the opinion either of
<i>Acrites</i> or <i>Mythogeras</i> in this matter; I know they
were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it—and are so
to this hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole
event——but that the chesnut’s taking that particular course, and
in a manner of its own accord—and then falling with all its
heat directly into that one particular place, and no
other——was a real judgment upon <i>Phutatorius</i> for
that filthy and obscene treatise <i>de Concubinis retinendis</i>,
which <i>Phutatorius</i> had published about twenty years
ago——and was that identical week going to give the
world a second edition of.</p>

<p>It is not my business to dip my pen in this
controversy——much undoubtedly may be wrote on both
sides of the question—all that concerns me as an historian,
is to represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to the
reader, that the hiatus in <i>Phutatorius</i>’s breeches was
sufficiently wide to receive the chesnut;——and that the
chesnut, somehow or other, did fall perpendicularly, and piping hot
into it, without <i>Phutatorius</i>’s perceiving it, or any
one else at that time.</p>

<p>The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted, was not
undelectable for the first twenty or five-and-twenty
seconds——and did no more than gently solicit
<i>Phutatorius</i>’s attention towards the
part:——But the heat gradually increasing, and in a few
seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober pleasure, and
then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain, the soul of
<i>Phutatorius</i>, together with all his ideas, his thoughts, his
attention, his imagination, judgment, resolution, deliberation,
ratiocination, memory, fancy, with ten battalions of animal
spirits, all tumultuously crowded down, through different defiles
and circuits, to the place of danger, leaving all his upper
regions, as you may imagine, as empty as my purse.</p>

<p>With the best intelligence which all these messengers could
bring him back, <i>Phutatorius</i> was not able to dive into the
secret of what was going forwards below, nor could he make any kind
of conjecture, what the devil was the matter with it: However, as
he knew not what the true cause might turn out, he deemed it most
prudent in the situation he was in at present, to bear it, if possible, like a Stoick;
which, with the help of some wry faces and compursions of the
mouth, he had certainly accomplished, had his imagination continued
neuter;——but the sallies of the imagination are
ungovernable in things of this kind—a thought instantly
darted into his mind, that tho’ the anguish had the sensation
of glowing heat—it might, notwithstanding that, be a bite as
well as a burn; and if so, that possibly a <i>Newt</i> or an
<i>Asker</i>, or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was
fastening his teeth——the horrid idea of which, with a
fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut, seized
<i>Phutatorius</i> with a sudden panick, and in the first
terrifying disorder of the passion, it threw him, as it has done
the best generals upon earth, quite off his guard:——the
effect of which was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering
as he rose that interjection of surprise so much descanted upon,
with the aposiopestic break after it, marked thus,
Z——ds—which, though not strictly canonical, was still as little as any man
could have said upon the occasion;——and which,
by-the-bye, whether canonical or not, <i>Phutatorius</i> could no
more help than he could the cause of it.</p>

<p>Though this has taken up some time in the narrative, it took up
little more time in the transaction, than just to allow time for
<i>Phutatorius</i> to draw forth the chesnut, and throw it down
with violence upon the floor—and for <i>Yorick</i> to rise
from his chair, and pick the chesnut up.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over
the mind:——What incredible weight they have in forming
and governing our opinions, both of men and
things——that trifles, light as air, shall waft a belief
into the soul, and plant it so immoveably within
it——that <i>Euclid</i>’s demonstrations, could
they be brought to batter it in breach, should not all have power
to overthrow it.</p>

<p><i>Yorick</i>, I said, picked up the chesnut which <i>Phutatorius</i>’s wrath had flung
down——the action was trifling——I am ashamed
to account for it—he did it, for no reason, but that he
thought the chesnut not a jot worse for the adventure—and
that he held a good chesnut worth stooping for.——But
this incident, trifling as it was, wrought differently in
<i>Phutatorius</i>’s head: He considered this act of
<i>Yorick</i>’s in getting off his chair and picking up the
chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment in him, that the chesnut was
originally his—and in course, that it must have been the
owner of the chesnut, and no one else, who could have played him
such a prank with it: What greatly confirmed him in this opinion,
was this, that the table being parallelogramical and very narrow,
it afforded a fair opportunity for <i>Yorick</i>, who sat directly
over against <i>Phutatorius</i>, of slipping the chesnut
in——and consequently that he did it. The look of
something more than suspicion, which <i>Phutatorius</i> cast full
upon <i>Yorick</i> as these thoughts arose, too evidently spoke
his opinion——and as <i>Phutatorius</i> was
naturally supposed to know more of the matter than any person
besides, his opinion at once became the general
one;——and for a reason very different from any which
have been yet given——in a little time it was put out of
all manner of dispute.</p>

<p>When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this
sublunary world——the mind of man, which is an
inquisitive kind of a substance, naturally takes a flight behind
the scenes to see what is the cause and first spring of
them.—The search was not long in this instance.</p>

<p>It was well known that <i>Yorick</i> had never a good opinion of
the treatise which <i>Phutatorius</i> had wrote <i>de Concubinis
retinendis</i>, as a thing which he feared had done hurt in the
world——and ’twas easily found out, that there was
a mystical meaning in <i>Yorick</i>’s prank—and that
his chucking the chesnut hot into <i>Phutatorius</i>’s
***——***, was a sarcastical fling at his book—the
doctrines of which, they said, had enflamed many an honest man in the
same place.</p>

<p>This conceit awaken’d <i>Somnolentus</i>——made
<i>Agelastes</i> smile——and if you can recollect the
precise look and air of a man’s face intent in finding out a
riddle——it threw <i>Gastripheres</i>’s into that
form—and in short was thought by many to be a master-stroke
of arch-wit.</p>

<p>This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as
groundless as the dreams of philosophy: <i>Yorick</i>, no doubt, as
<i>Shakespeare</i> said of his ancestor——“<i>was
a man of jest</i>,” but it was temper’d with something
which withheld him from that, and many other ungracious pranks, of
which he as undeservedly bore the blame;—but it was his
misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and
doing a thousand things, of which (unless my esteem blinds me) his
nature was incapable. All I blame him for——or rather,
all I blame and alternately like him for, was that singularity of
his temper, which would never suffer him to take pains to set a story right with the world,
however in his power. In every ill usage of that sort, he acted
precisely as in the affair of his lean horse——he could
have explained it to his honour, but his spirit was above it; and
besides, he ever looked upon the inventor, the propagator and
believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious to him—he
could not stoop to tell his story to them——and so
trusted to time and truth to do it for him.</p>

<p>This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many
respects—in the present it was followed by the fixed
resentment of <i>Phutatorius</i>, who, as <i>Yorick</i> had just
made an end of his chesnut, rose up from his chair a second time,
to let him know it—which indeed he did with a smile; saying
only—that he would endeavour not to forget the
obligation.</p>

<p>But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these
two things in your mind.</p>

<p>——The smile was for the company.</p>

<p>——The threat was for <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>—C<small>AN</small> you tell me, quoth
<i>Phutatorius</i>, speaking <i>to Gastripheres</i> who sat next to
him——for one would not apply to a surgeon in so foolish
an affair——can you tell me, <i>Gastripheres</i>, what
is best to take out the fire?——Ask <i>Eugenius</i>,
said <i>Gastripheres.</i>——That greatly depends, said
<i>Eugenius</i>, pretending ignorance of the adventure, upon the
nature of the part——If it is a tender part, and a part
which can conveniently be wrapt up——It is both the one
and the other, replied <i>Phutatorius</i>, laying his hand as he
spoke, with an emphatical nod of his head, upon the part in
question, and lifting up his right leg at the same time to ease and
ventilate it.——If that is the case, said
<i>Eugenius</i>, I would advise you, <i>Phutatorius</i>, not to
tamper with it by any means; but if you will send to the next
printer, and trust your cure to such a simple thing as a soft sheet
of paper just come off the press—you need do nothing more than twist it
round.—The damp paper, quoth <i>Yorick</i> (who sat next to
his friend <i>Eugenius</i>) though I know it has a refreshing
coolness in it—yet I presume is no more than the
vehicle—and that the oil and lamp-black with which the paper
is so strongly impregnated, does the business.—Right, said
<i>Eugenius</i>, and is, of any outward application I would venture
to recommend, the most anodyne and safe.</p>

<p>Was it my case, said <i>Gastripheres</i>, as the main thing is
the oil and lamp-black, I should spread them thick upon a rag, and
clap it on directly.——That would make a very devil of
it, replied <i>Yorick.</i>——And besides, added
<i>Eugenius</i>, it would not answer the intention, which is the
extreme neatness and elegance of the prescription, which the
Faculty hold to be half in half;——for consider, if the
type is a very small one (which it should be) the sanative
particles, which come into contact in this form, have the advantage
of being spread so infinitely thin, and with such a mathematical equality (fresh
paragraphs and large capitals excepted) as no art or management of
the spatula can come up to.——It falls out very luckily,
replied <i>Phutatorius</i>, that the second edition of my treatise
<i>de Concubinis retinendis</i> is at this instant in the
press.——You may take any leaf of it, said
<i>Eugenius</i>——no matter
which.——Provided, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, there is no
bawdry in it.——</p>

<p>They are just now, replied <i>Phutatorius</i>, printing off the
ninth chapter——which is the last chapter but one in the
book.——Pray what is the title of that chapter? said
<i>Yorick;</i> making a respectful bow to <i>Phutatorius</i> as he
spoke.——I think, answered <i>Phutatorius</i>,
’tis that <i>de re concubinaria.</i></p>

<p>For Heaven’s sake keep out of that chapter, quoth
<i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>——By all means—added <i>Eugenius.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>—N<small>OW</small>, quoth <i>Didius</i>,
rising up, and laying his right hand with his fingers spread upon
his breast——had such a blunder about a christian-name
happened before the Reformation——[It happened the day
before yesterday, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> to himself]—and
when baptism was administer’d in
<i>Latin</i>—[’Twas all in <i>English</i>, said my
uncle]——many things might have coincided with it, and
upon the authority of sundry decreed cases, to have pronounced the
baptism null, with a power of giving the child a new name—Had
a priest, for instance, which was no uncommon thing, through
ignorance of the <i>Latin</i> tongue, baptized a child of
Tom-o’stiles, <i>in nomine patriæ &amp; filia &amp;
spiritum sanctos</i>—the baptism was held
null.——I beg your pardon, replied
<i>Kysarcius</i>——in that case, as the mistake was only
the <i>terminations</i>, the baptism was valid——and to
have rendered it null, the blunder of the priest should have fallen
upon the first syllable of each noun——and not, as in
your case, upon the last.</p>

<p>My father delighted in subtleties of this kind, and
listen’d with infinite attention.</p>

<p><i>Gastripheres</i>, for example, continued <i>Kysarcius</i>,
baptizes a child of <i>John Stradling</i>’s in <i>Gomine</i>
gatris, &amp;c. &amp;c. instead of <i>in Nomine patris</i>,
&amp;c.——Is this a baptism? No—say the ablest
canonists; in as much as the radix of each word is hereby torn up,
and the sense and meaning of them removed and changed quite to
another object; for <i>Gomine</i> does not signify a name, nor
<i>gatris</i> a father.—What do they signify? said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.—Nothing at all——quoth
<i>Yorick.</i>——Ergo, such a baptism is null, said
<i>Kysarcius.</i>——</p>

<p>In course, answered <i>Yorick</i>, in a tone two parts jest and
one part earnest.——</p>

<p>But in the case cited, continued <i>Kysarcius</i>, where
<i>patriæ</i> is put for <i>patris, filia</i> for
<i>filii</i>, and so on——as it is a fault only in the declension, and the roots of the
words continue untouch’d, the inflections of their branches
either this way or that, does not in any sort hinder the baptism,
inasmuch as the same sense continues in the words as
before.——But then, said <i>Didius</i>, the intention of
the priest’s pronouncing them grammatically must have been
proved to have gone along with
it.——————Right, answered
<i>Kysarcius;</i> and of this, brother <i>Didius</i>, we have an
instance in a decree of the decretals of Pope <i>Leo</i> the
IIId.——But my brother’s child, cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, has nothing to do with the
Pope——’tis the plain child of a Protestant
gentleman, christen’d <i>Tristram</i> against the wills and
wishes both of his father and mother, and all who are a-kin to
it.——</p>

<p>If the wills and wishes, said <i>Kysarcius</i>, interrupting my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, of those only who stand related to Mr.
<i>Shandy</i>’s child, were to have weight in this matter,
Mrs. <i>Shandy</i>, of all people, has the least to do in
it.——My uncle <i>Toby</i> lay’d down his pipe, and my father drew his chair still closer to
the table, to hear the conclusion of so strange an
introduction.</p>

<p>
——It has not only been a question, Captain <i>Shandy</i>, amongst
the<a href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> best lawyers and civilians in this
land, continued <i>Kysarcius, “Whether the mother be of kin to her
child,”</i>—but, after much dispassionate enquiry and jactitation
of the arguments on all sides—it has been adjudged for the
negative—namely, <i>“That the mother is not of kin to her
child.”</i><a href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> My father instantly clapp’d his
hand upon my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s mouth, under colour of whispering in his
ear;—the truth was, he was alarmed for <i>Lillabullero</i>—and
having a great desire to hear more of so curious an argument—he
begg’d my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for heaven’s sake, not to disappoint
him in it.—My uncle <i>Toby</i> gave a nod—resumed his pipe, and
contenting himself with whistling <i>Lillabullero</i>
inwardly——<i>Kysarcius, Didius</i>, and <i>Triptolemus</i> went on
with the discourse as follows:
</p>

<p>This determination, continued <i>Kysarcius</i>, how
contrary soever it may seem to run to the stream of vulgar ideas,
yet had reason strongly on its side; and has been put out of all
manner of dispute from the famous case, known commonly by the name
of the Duke of <i>Suffolk</i>’s case.——It is
cited in <i>Brook</i>, said <i>Triptolemus</i>——And
taken notice of by Lord <i>Coke</i>, added <i>Didius.</i>—And
you may find it in <i>Swinburn</i> on Testaments, said
<i>Kysarcius.</i></p>

<p>The case, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, was this:</p>

<p>In the reign of <i>Edward</i> the Sixth, <i>Charles</i> duke of
<i>Suffolk</i> having issue a son by one venter, and a daughter by
another venter, made his last will, wherein he devised goods to his
son, and died; after whose death the son died also——but
without will, without wife, and without child—his mother and
his sister by the father’s side (for she was born of the
former venter) then living. The mother took the administration of
her son’s goods, according to the statute of the 21st of <i>Harry</i> the Eighth, whereby it is
enacted, That in case any person die intestate the administration
of his goods shall be committed to the next of kin.</p>

<p>The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the
mother, the sister by the father’s side commenced a suit
before the Ecclesiastical Judge, alledging, 1st, That she herself
was next of kin; and 2dly, That the mother was not of kin at all to
the party deceased; and therefore prayed the court, that the
administration granted to the mother might be revoked, and be
committed unto her, as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the
said statute.</p>

<p>
Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its issue—and
many causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come, by the
precedent to be then made——the most learned, as well in the laws of
this realm, as in the civil law, were consulted together, whether the mother
was of kin to her son, or no.—Whereunto not only the temporal
lawyers——but the church lawyers—the juris-consulti—the
jurisprudentes—the civilians—the advocates—the
commissaries—the judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of
<i>Canterbury</i> and <i>York</i>, with the master of the faculties, were all
unanimously of opinion, That the mother was not of<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> kin to her
child.——
</p>

<p>And what said the duchess of <i>Suffolk</i> to it? said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s question,
confounded <i>Kysarcius</i> more than the ablest
advocate——He stopp’d a full minute, looking in my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s face without replying——and in
that single minute <i>Triptolemus</i> put by him, and took the lead
as follows.</p>

<p>’Tis a ground and principle in the law, said
<i>Triptolemus</i>, that things do not ascend, but descend in it;
and I make no doubt ’tis for this cause, that however true it
is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of its parents——that
the parents, nevertheless, are not of the blood and seed of it;
inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child, but the child
by the parents—For so they write, <i>Liberi sunt de sanguine
patris &amp; matris, sed pater &amp; mater non sunt de sanguine
liberorum.</i></p>

<p>
——But this, <i>Triptolemus</i>, cried Didius, proves too
much—for from this authority cited it would follow, not only what indeed
is granted on all sides, that the mother is not of kin to her child—but
the father likewise.——It is held, said <i>Triptolemus</i>, the
better opinion; because the father, the mother, and the child, though they be
three persons, yet are they but (<i>una caro</i><a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>) one flesh; and
consequently no degree of kindred——or any method of acquiring one
<i>in nature.</i>——There you push the argument again too far, cried
<i>Didius</i>——for there is no prohibition <i>in nature</i>, though
there is in the Levitical law——but that a man may beget a child
upon his grandmother——in which case, supposing the issue a
daughter, she would stand in relation both of——But who ever
thought, cried <i>Kysarcius</i>, of laying with his
grandmother?——The young gentleman, replied <i>Yorick</i>, whom
<i>Selden</i> speaks of——who not only thought of it, but justified
his intention to his father by the argument drawn from the law of
retaliation.—“You laid, Sir, with my mother,” said the
lad—“why may not I lay with yours?”——’Tis
the <i>Argumentum commune</i>, added <i>Yorick.</i>——’Tis as
good, replied <i>Eugenius</i>, taking down his hat, as they deserve.

<p>The company broke up.</p>

</h3>

<p>—A<small>ND</small> pray, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, leaning upon <i>Yorick</i>, as he and my father were
helping him leisurely down the stairs——don’t be
terrified, madam, this stair-case conversation is not so long as the last——And pray,
<i>Yorick</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, which way is this said
affair of <i>Tristram</i> at length settled by these learned men?
Very satisfactorily, replied <i>Yorick;</i> no mortal, Sir, has any
concern with it——for Mrs. <i>Shandy</i> the mother is
nothing at all a-kin to him——and as the mother’s
is the surest side——Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, in course is
still less than nothing——In short, he is not as much
a-kin to him, Sir, as I am.——</p>

<p>——That may well be, said my father, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>——Let the learned say what they will, there must
certainly, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, have been some sort of
consanguinity betwixt the duchess of <i>Suffolk</i> and her
son.</p>

<p>The vulgar are of the same opinion, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, to this
hour.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> my father was hugely tickled
with the subtleties of these learned
discourses——’twas still but like the anointing of
a broken bone——The moment he got home, the weight of
his afflictions returned upon him but so much the heavier, as is
ever the case when the staff we lean on slips from under
us.—He became pensive—walked frequently forth to the
fish-pond—let down one loop of his
hat——sigh’d often——forbore to
snap—and, as the hasty sparks of temper, which occasion
snapping, so much assist perspiration and digestion, as
<i>Hippocrates</i> tells us—he had certainly fallen ill with
the extinction of them, had not his thoughts been critically drawn
off, and his health rescued by a fresh train of disquietudes left
him, with a legacy of a thousand pounds, by my aunt
<i>Dinah.</i></p>

<p>My father had scarce read the letter, when taking the thing by
the right end, he instantly began to plague and puzzle his head how
to lay it out mostly to the honour of his family.—A
hundred-and-fifty odd projects took possession of his brains by
turns—he would do this, and that and t’other—He
would go to <i>Rome</i>——he would go to
law——he would buy stock——he would buy
<i>John Hobson</i>’s farm—he would new fore front his
house, and add a new wing to make it even——There was a
fine water-mill on this side, and he would build a wind-mill on the
other side of the river in full view to answer it—But above
all things in the world, he would inclose the great <i>Ox-moor</i>,
and send out my brother <i>Bobby</i> immediately upon his
travels.</p>

<p>But as the sum was finite, and consequently could not do every
thing——and in truth very few of these to any
purpose—of all the projects which offered themselves upon
this occasion, the two last seemed to make the deepest impression; and he would infallibly have determined
upon both at once, but for the small inconvenience hinted at above,
which absolutely put him under a necessity of deciding in favour
either of the one or the other.</p>

<p>This was not altogether so easy to be done; for though
’tis certain my father had long before set his heart upon
this necessary part of my brother’s education, and like a
prudent man had actually determined to carry it into execution,
with the first money that returned from the second creation of
actions in the <i>Missisippi</i>-scheme, in which he was an
adventurer——yet the <i>Ox-moor</i>, which was a fine,
large, whinny, undrained, unimproved common, belonging to the
<i>Shandy</i>-estate, had almost as old a claim upon him: he had
long and affectionately set his heart upon turning it likewise to
some account.</p>

<p>But having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture
of things, as made it necessary to settle either the priority or justice of their claims——like a
wise man he had refrained entering into any nice or critical
examination about them: so that upon the dismission of every other
project at this crisis——the two old projects, the
O<small>X-MOOR</small> and my B<small>ROTHER</small>, divided him
again; and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become
the occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman’s
mind—which of the two should be set o’going first.</p>

<p>——People may laugh as they will—but the case
was this.</p>

<p>It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time
was almost become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of
it should have free ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts
before marriage—not only for the sake of bettering his own
private parts, by the benefit of exercise and change of so much
air—but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy, by the
feather put into his cap, of having been abroad—<i>tantum valet</i>, my father would say,
<i>quantum sonat.</i></p>

<p>Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian
indulgence——to deprive him of it, without why or
wherefore——and thereby make an example of him, as the
first <i>Shandy</i> unwhirl’d about <i>Europe</i> in a
post-chaise, and only because he was a heavy lad——would
be using him ten times worse than a <i>Turk.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, the case of the <i>Ox-moor</i> was full as
hard.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the original purchase-money, which was eight
hundred pounds——it had cost the family eight hundred
pounds more in a law-suit about fifteen years before—besides
the Lord knows what trouble and vexation.</p>

<p>It had been moreover in possession of the <i>Shandy</i>-family
ever since the middle of the last century; and though it lay full
in view before the house, bounded on one extremity by the
water-mill, and on the other by the projected wind-mill spoken of above—and for all these reasons
seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the
care and protection of the family—yet by an unaccountable
fatality, common to men, as well as the ground they tread
on——it had all along most shamefully been
overlook’d; and to speak the truth of it, had suffered so
much by it, that it would have made any man’s heart have bled
(<i>Obadiah</i> said) who understood the value of the land, to have
rode over it, and only seen the condition it was in.</p>

<p>However, as neither the purchasing this tract of
ground—nor indeed the placing of it where it lay, were either
of them, properly speaking, of my father’s
doing——he had never thought himself any way concerned
in the affair——till the fifteen years before, when the
breaking out of that cursed law-suit mentioned above (and which had
arose about its boundaries)——which being altogether my
father’s own act and deed, it naturally awakened every other
argument in its favour, and upon summing them all up
together, he saw, not merely in interest, but in honour, he was
bound to do something for it——and that now or never was
the time.</p>

<p>I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in
it, that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally
balanced by each other; for though my father weigh’d them in
all humours and conditions——spent many an anxious hour
in the most profound and abstracted meditation upon what was best
to be done—reading books of farming one
day——books of travels another——laying aside
all passion whatever—viewing the arguments on both sides in
all their lights and circumstances—communing every day with
my uncle <i>Toby</i>—arguing with <i>Yorick</i>, and talking
over the whole affair of the <i>Ox-moor</i> with
<i>Obadiah</i>——yet nothing in all that time appeared
so strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either strictly
applicable to the other, or at least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of equal
weight, as to keep the scales even.</p>

<p>For to be sure, with proper helps, in the hands of some people,
tho’ the <i>Ox-moor</i> would undoubtedly have made a
different appearance in the world from what it did, or ever could
do in the condition it lay——yet every tittle of this
was true, with regard to my brother <i>Bobby</i>——let
<i>Obadiah</i> say what he would.——</p>

<p>In point of interest——the contest, I own, at first
sight, did not appear so undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my
father took pen and ink in hand, and set about calculating the
simple expence of paring and burning, and fencing in the
<i>Ox-moor</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.—with the certain profit it
would bring him in return——the latter turned out so
prodigiously in his way of working the account, that you would have
sworn the <i>Ox-moor</i> would have carried all before it. For it
was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape, at twenty pounds a last, the very first
year——besides an excellent crop of wheat the year
following——and the year after that, to speak within
bounds, a hundred——but in all likelihood, a hundred and
fifty——if not two hundred quarters of pease and
beans——besides potatoes without end.——But
then, to think he was all this while breeding up my brother, like a
hog to eat them——knocked all on the head again, and
generally left the old gentleman in such a state of
suspense——that, as he often declared to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——he knew no more than his heels what to
do.</p>

<p>No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing
thing it is to have a man’s mind torn asunder by two projects
of equal strength, both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction
at the same time: for to say nothing of the havock, which by a
certain consequence is unavoidably made by it all over the finer
system of the nerves, which you know convey the animal spirits and more subtle
juices from the heart to the head, and so on——it is not
to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works
upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing
the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and
forwards.</p>

<p>My father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he
had done under that of my <small>CHRISTIAN
NAME</small>——had he not been rescued out of it, as he
was out of that, by a fresh evil——the misfortune of my
brother <i>Bobby</i>’s death.</p>

<p>What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to
side?——from sorrow to sorrow?——to button up
one cause of vexation——and unbutton another?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>F<small>ROM</small> this moment I am to be
considered as heir-apparent to the <i>Shandy</i>
family——and it is from this point properly, that the
story of my L<small>IFE</small> and my O<small>PINIONS</small> sets
out. With all my hurry and precipitation, I have but been clearing
the ground to raise the building——and such a building
do I foresee it will turn out, as never was planned, and as never
was executed since <i>Adam.</i> In less than five minutes I shall
have thrown my pen into the fire, and the little drop of thick ink
which is left remaining at the bottom of my ink-horn, after
it—I have but half a score things to do in the
time——I have a thing to name——a thing to
lament——a thing to hope——a thing to
promise, and a thing to threaten—I have a thing to
suppose—a thing to declare——a thing to
conceal——a thing to choose, and a thing to pray for——This chapter,
therefore, I <i>name</i> the chapter of
T<small>HINGS</small>——and my next chapter to it, that
is, the first chapter of my next volume, if I live, shall be my
chapter upon <small>WHISKERS</small>, in order to keep up some sort
of connection in my works.</p>

<p>The thing I lament is, that things have crowded in so thick upon
me, that I have not been able to get into that part of my work,
towards which I have all the way looked forwards, with so much
earnest desire; and that is the Campaigns, but especially the
amours of my uncle <i>Toby</i>, the events of which are of so
singular a nature, and so Cervantick a cast, that if I can so
manage it, as to convey but the same impressions to every other
brain, which the occurrences themselves excite in my own—I
will answer for it the book shall make its way in the world, much
better than its master has done before it.——Oh
<i>Tristram! Tristram!</i> can this but be once brought
about——the credit, which will attend thee as an author, shall counterbalance the many
evils will have befallen thee as a man——thou wilt feast
upon the one——when thou hast lost all sense and
remembrance of the other!——</p>

<p>No wonder I itch so much as I do, to get at these
amours—They are the choicest morsel of my whole story! and
when I do get at ’em——assure yourselves, good
folks—(nor do I value whose squeamish stomach takes offence
at it) I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my
words!——and that’s the thing I have to
<i>declare.</i>——I shall never get all through in five
minutes, that I fear——and the thing I <i>hope</i> is,
that your worships and reverences are not offended—if you
are, depend upon’t I’ll give you something, my good
gentry, next year to be offended at——that’s my
dear <i>Jenny</i>’s way—but who my <i>Jenny</i>
is—and which is the right and which the wrong end of a woman,
is the thing to be <i>concealed</i>—it shall be told you in
the next chapter but one to my chapter of Button-holes——and not one chapter
before.</p>

<p>
And now that you have just got to the end of these<a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> three
volumes——the thing I have to <i>ask</i> is, how you feel your
heads? my own akes dismally!——as for your healths, I know, they are
much better.—True <i>Shandeism</i>, think what you will against it, opens
the heart and lungs, and like all those affections which partake of its nature,
it forces the blood and other vital fluids of the body to run freely through
its channels, makes the wheel of life run long and cheerfully round.
</p>

<p>Was I left, like <i>Sancho Pança</i>, to choose my
kingdom, it should not be maritime—or a kingdom of blacks to
make a penny of;—no, it should be a kingdom of hearty
laughing subjects: And as the bilious and more saturnine passions,
by creating disorders in the blood and humours, have as bad an
influence, I see, upon the body politick as body natural——and as nothing but a
habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject them
to reason——I should add to my prayer—that God
would give my subjects grace to be as <small>WISE</small> as they
were <small>MERRY</small>; and then should I be the happiest
monarch, and they are the happiest people under heaven.</p>

<p>And so with this moral for the present, may it please your
worships and your reverences, I take my leave of you till this time
twelve-month, when, (unless this vile cough kills me in the mean
time) I’ll have another pluck at your beards, and lay open a
story to the world you little dream of.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp; &nbsp;I</small><br>
</h3>

<p>I<small>F</small> it had not been for those two
mettlesome tits, and that madcap of a postillion who drove them
from Stilton to Stamford, the thought had never entered my head. He
flew like lightning——there was a slope of three miles
and a half——we scarce touched the
ground——the motion was most rapid——most
impetuous——’twas communicated to my
brain—my heart partook of it——“By the
great God of day,” said I, looking towards the sun, and
thrusting my arm out of the fore-window of the chaise, as I made my
vow, “I will lock up my study-door the moment I get home, and throw the key of it ninety feet below the
surface of the earth, into the draw-well at the back of my
house.”</p>

<p>The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution; it hung
tottering upon the hill, scarce progressive,
drag’d—drag’d up by eight <i>heavy
beasts</i>—“by main strength!——quoth
I, nodding——but your betters draw the same
way——and something of every
body’s!——O rare!”</p>

<p>Tell me, ye learned, shall we for ever be adding so much to the
<i>bulk</i>—so little to the <i>stock?</i></p>

<p>Shall we for ever make new books, as apothecaries make new
mixtures, by pouring only out of one vessel into another?</p>

<p>Are we for ever to be twisting, and untwisting the same rope?
for ever in the same track—for ever at the same pace?</p>

<p>Shall we be destined to the days of eternity, on holy-days, as
well as working-days, to be shewing the <i>relicks of learning</i>,
as monks do the relicks of their saints—without working
one—one single miracle with them?</p>

<p>Who made Man, with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in
a moment—that great, that most excellent, and most noble
creature of the world—the <i>miracle</i> of nature, as
Zoroaster in his book ωεσι
φυσεως called
him—the S<small>HEKINAH</small> of the divine presence, as
Chrysostom——the <i>image</i> of God, as
Moses——the <i>ray</i> of divinity, as Plato—the
<i>marvel</i> of <i>marvels</i>, as Aristotle—to go sneaking
on at this pitiful—pimping——pettifogging
rate?</p>

<p>I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the
occasion——but if there is no catachresis in the wish,
and no sin in it, I wish from my soul, that every imitator in
<i>Great Britain, France</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>, had the farcy for
his pains; and that there was a good farcical house, large enough
to hold—aye—and sublimate them, <i>shag rag and
bob-tail</i>, male and female, all together: and this leads me to
the affair of <i>Whiskers</i>——but, by what chain of
ideas—I leave as a legacy in <i>mort-main</i> to Prudes and
Tartufs, to enjoy and make the most of.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>UPON WHISKERS.</small>
</p>

<p>I’m sorry I made it——’twas as
inconsiderate a promise as ever entered a man’s
head——A chapter upon whiskers! alas! the world will not
bear it—’tis a delicate world——but I knew
not of what mettle it was made—nor had I ever seen the
under-written fragment; otherwise, as surely as noses are noses,
and whiskers are whiskers still (let the world say what it will to
the contrary); so surely would I have steered clear of this
dangerous chapter.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>THE FRAGMENT.</small>
</p>

<p>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *<br>
* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *<br>
——You are half asleep, my good lady, said the old
gentleman, taking hold of the old lady’s hand, and giving it
a gentle squeeze, as he pronounced the word
<i>Whiskers</i>——shall we change the subject? By no
means, replied the old lady—I like your account of those
matters; so throwing a thin gauze handkerchief over her
head, and leaning it back upon the chair with her face turned
towards him, and advancing her two feet as she reclined
herself——I desire, continued she, you will go on.</p>

<p>The old gentleman went on as follows:——Whiskers!
cried the queen of <i>Navarre</i>, dropping her knotting ball, as
<i>La Fosseuse</i> uttered the word——Whiskers, madam,
said <i>La Fosseuse</i>, pinning the ball to the queen’s
apron, and making a courtesy as she repeated it.</p>

<p><i>La Fosseuse</i>’s voice was naturally soft and low, yet
’twas an articulate voice: and every letter of the word
<i>Whiskers</i> fell distinctly upon the queen of
<i>Navarre</i>’s ear—Whiskers! cried the queen, laying
a greater stress upon the word, and as if she had still distrusted
her ears——Whiskers! replied <i>La Fosseuse</i>,
repeating the word a third time——There is not a
cavalier, madam, of his age in <i>Navarre</i>, continued the maid
of honour, pressing the page’s interest upon the queen, that
has so gallant a pair——Of what? cried
<i>Margaret</i>, smiling—Of whiskers, said <i>La Fosseuse</i>,
with infinite modesty.</p>

<p>The word <i>Whiskers</i> still stood its ground, and continued
to be made use of in most of the best companies throughout the
little kingdom of <i>Navarre</i>, notwithstanding the indiscreet
use which <i>La Fosseuse</i> had made of it: the truth was, <i>La
Fosseuse</i> had pronounced the word, not only before the queen,
but upon sundry other occasions at court, with an accent which
always implied something of a mystery—And as the court of
<i>Margaret</i>, as all the world knows, was at that time a mixture
of gallantry and devotion——and whiskers being as
applicable to the one, as the other, the word naturally stood its
ground——it gained full as much as it lost; that is, the
clergy were for it——the laity were against
it——and for the women,——<i>they</i> were
divided.</p>

<p>The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur <i>De
Croix</i>, was at that time beginning to draw the attention of the
maids of honour towards the terrace before the palace gate, where
the guard was mounted. The lady <i>De Baussiere</i> fell
deeply in love with him,——<i>La Battarelle</i> did the
same—it was the finest weather for it, that ever was
remembered in <i>Navarre——La Guyol, La Maronette, La
Sabatiere</i>, fell in love with the Sieur <i>De Croix</i>
also——<i>La Rebours</i> and <i>La Fosseuse</i> knew
better——<i>De Croix</i> had failed in an attempt to
recommend himself to <i>La Rebours;</i> and <i>La Rebours</i> and
<i>La Fosseuse</i> were inseparable.</p>

<p>The queen of <i>Navarre</i> was sitting with her ladies in the
painted bow-window, facing the gate of the second court, as <i>De
Croix</i> passed through it—He is handsome, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere</i>——He has a good mien, said <i>La
Battarelle</i>——He is finely shaped, said <i>La
Guyol</i>—I never saw an officer of the horse-guards in my
life, said <i>La Maronette</i>, with two such legs——Or
who stood so well upon them, said <i>La
Sabatiere</i>——But he has no whiskers, cried <i>La
Fosseuse</i>——Not a pile, said <i>La Rebours.</i></p>

<p>The queen went directly to her oratory, musing all the way, as
she walked through the gallery, upon the subject; turning it
this way and that way in her fancy—<i>Ave
Maria!</i>——what can <i>La-Fosseuse</i> mean? said she,
kneeling down upon the cushion.</p>

<p><i>La Guyol, La Battarelle, La Maronette, La Sabatiere</i>,
retired instantly to their chambers——Whiskers! said all
four of them to themselves, as they bolted their doors on the
inside.</p>

<p>The Lady <i>Carnavallette</i> was counting her beads with both
hands, unsuspected, under her farthingal——from St.
<i>Antony</i> down to St. <i>Ursula</i> inclusive, not a saint
passed through her fingers without whiskers; St. <i>Francis</i>,
St. <i>Dominick</i>, St. <i>Bennet</i>, St. <i>Basil</i>, St.
<i>Bridget</i>, had all whiskers.</p>

<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> had got into a wilderness of conceits,
with moralizing too intricately upon <i>La Fosseuse</i>’s
text——She mounted her palfrey, her page followed
her——the host passed by—the Lady <i>Baussiere</i>
rode on.</p>

<p>One denier, cried the order of mercy—one single denier, in
behalf of a thousand patient captives, whose eyes look towards
heaven and you for their redemption.</p>

<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>

<p>Pity the unhappy, said a devout, venerable, hoary-headed man,
meekly holding up a box, begirt with iron, in his withered
hands——I beg for the unfortunate—good my Lady,
’tis for a prison—for an hospital—’tis for
an old man—a poor man undone by shipwreck, by suretyship, by
fire——I call God and all his angels to
witness——’tis to clothe the naked——to
feed the hungry——’tis to comfort the sick and the
broken-hearted.</p>

<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>

<p>A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground.</p>

<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>

<p>He ran begging bare-headed on one side of her palfrey, conjuring
her by the former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,
&amp;c.——Cousin, aunt, sister, mother,——for
virtue’s sake, for your own, for mine, for Christ’s
sake, remember me——pity me.</p>

<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>

<p>Take hold of my whiskers, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere</i>—The page took hold of her palfrey. She
dismounted at the end of the terrace.</p>

<p>There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of
themselves about our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a
consciousness of it, somewhere about the heart, which serves but to
make these etchings the stronger—we see, spell, and put them
together without a dictionary.</p>

<p>Ha, ha! he, hee! cried <i>La Guyol</i> and <i>La Sabatiere</i>,
looking close at each other’s prints——Ho, ho!
cried <i>La Battarelle</i> and <i>Maronette</i>, doing the
same:—Whist! cried one—ft, ft,—said a
second—hush, quoth a third—poo, poo, replied a
fourth—gramercy! cried the Lady
<i>Carnavallette;</i>——’twas she who
bewhisker’d St. <i>Bridget.</i></p>

<p><i>La Fosseuse</i> drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair,
and having traced the outline of a small whisker, with the blunt
end of it, upon one side of her upper lip, put in into <i>La Rebours</i>’
hand—<i>La Rebours</i> shook her head.</p>

<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> coughed thrice into the inside of her
muff—<i>La Guyol</i> smiled—Fy, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere.</i> The queen of <i>Navarre</i> touched her eye with
the tip of her fore-finger—as much as to say, I understand
you all.</p>

<p>’Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined: <i>La
Fosseuse</i> had given it a wound, and it was not the better for
passing through all these defiles——It made a faint
stand, however, for a few months, by the expiration of which, the
Sieur <i>De Croix</i>, finding it high time to leave <i>Navarre</i>
for want of whiskers——the word in course became
indecent, and (after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for use.</p>

<p>The best word, in the best language of the best world, must have
suffered under such combinations.——The curate of
<i>d’Estella</i> wrote a book against them, setting forth the
dangers of accessory ideas, and warning the <i>Navarois</i> against
them.</p>

<p>Does not all the world know, said the curate
<i>d’Estella</i> at the conclusion of his work, that Noses
ran the same fate some centuries ago in most parts of
<i>Europe</i>, which Whiskers have now done in the kingdom of
<i>Navarre?</i>—The evil indeed spread no farther
then—but have not beds and bolsters, and night-caps and
chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since? Are
not trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles—and spigots
and faucets, in danger still from the same
association?—Chastity, by nature, the gentlest of all
affections—give it but its head——’tis like
a ramping and a roaring lion.</p>

<p>The drift of the curate <i>d’Estella</i>’s argument
was not understood.—They ran the scent the wrong
way.—The world bridled his ass at the tail.—And when
the <i>extremes</i> of <small>DELICACY</small>, and the
<i>beginnings</i> of <small>CONCUPISCENCE</small>, hold their next
provincial chapter together, they may decree that bawdy also.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;II</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> my father received the letter
which brought him the melancholy account of my brother
<i>Bobby</i>’s death, he was busy calculating the expence of
his riding post from <i>Calais</i> to <i>Paris</i>, and so on to
<i>Lyons.</i></p>

<p>’Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had
every foot of it to travel over again, and his calculation to begin
afresh, when he had almost got to the end of it, by
<i>Obadiah</i>’s opening the door to acquaint him the family
was out of yeast—and to ask whether he might not take the
great coach-horse early in the morning and ride in search of
some.—With all my heart, <i>Obadiah</i>, said my father
(pursuing his journey)—take the coach-horse, and
welcome.——But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said
<i>Obadiah.</i>——Poor creature! said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, vibrating the note back again, like a string in
unison. Then ride the <i>Scotch</i> horse, quoth my father hastily.—He cannot bear
a saddle upon his back, quoth <i>Obadiah</i>, for the whole
world.——The devil’s in that horse; then take
P<small>ATRIOT</small>, cried my father, and shut the
door.——P<small>ATRIOT</small> is sold, said
<i>Obadiah.</i> Here’s for you! cried my father, making a
pause, and looking in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s face, as if the
thing had not been a matter of fact.—Your worship ordered me
to sell him last <i>April</i>, said <i>Obadiah.</i>—Then go
on foot for your pains, cried my father——I had much
rather walk than ride, said <i>Obadiah</i>, shutting the door.</p>

<p>What plagues, cried my father, going on with his
calculation.——But the waters are out, said
<i>Obadiah</i>,—opening the door again.</p>

<p>
Till that moment, my father, who had a map of <i>Sanson</i>’s, and a book
of the post-roads before him, had kept his hand upon the head of his compasses,
with one foot of them fixed upon <i>Nevers</i>, the last stage he had paid
for—purposing to go on from that point with his journey and calculation,
as soon as <i>Obadiah</i> quitted the room: but this second attack of
<i>Obadiah</i>’s, in opening the door and laying the whole country under
water, was too much.——He let go his compasses—or rather with
a mixed motion between accident and anger, he threw them upon the table; and
then there was nothing for him to do, but to return back to <i>Calais</i> (like
many others) as wise as he had set out.
</p>

<p>When the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained
the news of my brother’s death, my father had got forwards
again upon his journey to within a stride of the compasses of the
very same stage of <i>Nevers.</i>——By your leave, Mons.
<i>Sanson</i>, cried my father, striking the point of his compasses
through <i>Nevers</i> into the table—and nodding to my uncle
<i>Toby</i> to see what was in the letter—twice of one night,
is too much for an English gentleman and his son, Mons.
<i>Sanson</i>, to be turned back from so lousy a town as
<i>Nevers</i>—What think’st thou, <i>Toby</i>? added my
father in a sprightly tone.——Unless it be a garrison
town, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——for then—I shall be a fool, said
my father, smiling to himself, as long as I live.—So giving a
second nod—and keeping his compasses still upon <i>Nevers</i>
with one hand, and holding his book of the post-roads in the
other—half calculating and half listening, he leaned forwards
upon the table with both elbows, as my uncle <i>Toby</i> hummed
over the letter.</p>

<p>
—— —— —— ——
—— —— —— ——
—— —— —— ——
—— —— —— ——
—— —— —— —he’s
gone! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——Where——Who? cried my
father.——My nephew, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——What—without leave—without
money—without governor? cried my father in amazement. No:——he
is dead, my dear brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Without being ill?
cried my father again.—I dare say not, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in a
low voice, and fetching a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart, he has been
ill enough, poor lad! I’ll answer for him——for he is dead.
</p>

<p>When <i>Agrippina</i> was told of her son’s death,
<i>Tacitus</i> informs us, that, not being able to moderate the
violence of her passions, she abruptly broke off her work—My
father stuck his compasses into <i>Nevers</i>, but so much the
faster.—What contrarieties! his, indeed, was matter of
calculation!—<i>Agrippina</i>’s must have been quite a
different affair; who else could pretend to reason from
history?</p>

<p>How my father went on, in my opinion, deserves a chapter to
itself.—</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;III</small>
</h3>

<p>————And a chapter it shall
have, and a devil of a one too—so look to yourselves.</p>

<p>’Tis either <i>Plato</i>, or <i>Plutarch</i>, or
<i>Seneca</i>, or <i>Xenophon</i>, or <i>Epictetus</i>, or
<i>Theophrastus</i>, or <i>Lucian</i>—or some one perhaps of
later date—either <i>Cardan</i>, or <i>Budæus</i>, or
<i>Petrarch</i>, or <i>Stella</i>—or possibly it may be some
divine or father of the church, St. <i>Austin</i>, or St.
<i>Cyprian</i>, or <i>Barnard</i>, who affirms that it is an
irresistible and natural passion to weep for the loss of our
friends or children—and <i>Seneca</i> (I’m positive)
tells us somewhere, that such griefs evacuate themselves best by
that particular channel—And accordingly we find, that
<i>David</i> wept for his son <i>Absalom</i>—<i>Adrian</i>
for his <i>Antinous</i>—<i>Niobe</i> for her children, and
that <i>Apollodorus</i> and <i>Crito</i> both shed tears for
<i>Socrates</i> before his death.</p>

<p>My father managed his affliction otherwise; and indeed
differently from most men either ancient or modern; for he neither
wept it away, as the <i>Hebrews</i> and the <i>Romans</i>—or
slept it off, as the <i>Laplanders</i>—or hanged it, as the
<i>English</i>, or drowned it, as the <i>Germans</i>,—nor did
he curse it, or damn it, or excommunicate it, or rhyme it, or
lillabullero it.——</p>

<p>——He got rid of it, however.</p>

<p>Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between
these two pages?</p>

<p>When <i>Tully</i> was bereft of his dear daughter <i>Tullia</i>,
at first he laid it to his heart,—he listened to the voice of nature, and
modulated his own unto it.—O my <i>Tullia!</i> my daughter!
my child!—still, still, still,—’twas O my
<i>Tullia!</i>—my <i>Tullia!</i> Methinks I see my
<i>Tullia</i>, I hear my <i>Tullia</i>, I talk with my
<i>Tullia.</i>—But as soon as he began to look into the
stores of philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might
be said upon the occasion—no body upon earth can conceive,
says the great orator, how happy, how joyful it made me.</p>

<p>My father was as proud of his eloquence as M<small>ARCUS</small>
T<small>ULLIUS</small> C<small>ICERO</small> could be for his life,
and, for aught I am convinced of to the contrary at present, with
as much reason: it was indeed his strength—and his weakness
too.——His strength—for he was by nature eloquent;
and his weakness—for he was hourly a dupe to it; and,
provided an occasion in life would but permit him to shew his
talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty, or a shrewd
one—(bating the case of a systematic misfortune)—he had
all he wanted.—A blessing which tied up my father’s tongue, and a
misfortune which let it loose with a good grace, were pretty equal:
sometimes, indeed, the misfortune was the better of the two; for
instance, where the pleasure of the harangue was as <i>ten</i>, and
the pain of the misfortune but as <i>five</i>—my father
gained half in half, and consequently was as well again off, as if
it had never befallen him.</p>

<p>This clue will unravel what otherwise would seem very
inconsistent in my father’s domestic character; and it is
this, that, in the provocations arising from the neglects and
blunders of servants, or other mishaps unavoidable in a family, his
anger, or rather the duration of it, eternally ran counter to all
conjecture.</p>

<p>My father had a favourite little mare, which he had consigned
over to a most beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have a pad out
of her for his own riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so
talked about his pad every day with as absolute a security, as if
it had been reared, broke,—and bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting. By some neglect or
other in <i>Obadiah</i>, it so fell out, that my father’s
expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule, and as
ugly a beast of the kind as ever was produced.</p>

<p>My mother and my uncle <i>Toby</i> expected my father would be
the death of <i>Obadiah</i>—and that there never would be an
end of the disaster——See here! you rascal, cried my
father, pointing to the mule, what you have done!——It
was not me, said <i>Obadiah.</i>——How do I know that?
replied my father.</p>

<p>Triumph swam in my father’s eyes, at the
repartee—the <i>Attic</i> salt brought water into
them—and so <i>Obadiah</i> heard no more about it.</p>

<p>Now let us go back to my brother’s death.</p>

<p>Philosophy has a fine saying for every thing.—For
<i>Death</i> it has an entire set; the misery was, they all at once
rushed into my father’s head, that ’twas difficult to
string them together, so as to make any thing of a consistent show out of them.—He
took them as they came.</p>

<p>“’Tis an inevitable chance—the first
statute in <i>Magna Charta</i>—it is an everlasting act of
parliament, my dear brother,—<i>All must die.</i></p>

<p>“If my son could not have died, it had been matter
of wonder,—not that he is dead.</p>

<p>“Monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with
us.</p>

<p>“—<i>To die</i>, is the great debt and tribute
due unto nature: tombs and monuments, which should perpetuate our
memories, pay it themselves; and the proudest pyramid of them all,
which wealth and science have erected, has lost its apex, and
stands obtruncated in the traveller’s horizon.” (My
father found he got great ease, and went
on)—“Kingdoms and provinces, and towns and
cities, have they not their periods? and when those principles and
powers, which at first cemented and put them together, performed their several evolutions,
they fall back.”—Brother <i>Shandy</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, laying down his pipe at the word
<i>evolutions</i>—Revolutions, I meant, quoth my
father,—by heaven! I meant revolutions, brother
<i>Toby</i>—evolutions is nonsense.——’Tis
not nonsense—said my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——But is
it not nonsense to break the thread of such a discourse upon such
an occasion? cried my father—do not—dear <i>Toby</i>,
continued he, taking him by the hand, do not—do not, I
beseech thee, interrupt me at this crisis.——My uncle
<i>Toby</i> put his pipe into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Where is <i>Troy</i> and <i>Mycenæ</i>, and
<i>Thebes</i> and <i>Delos</i>, and <i>Persepolis</i> and
<i>Agrigentum?</i>”—continued my father, taking up his
book of post-roads, which he had laid down.—“What
is become, brother <i>Toby</i>, of <i>Nineveh</i> and
<i>Babylon</i>, of <i>Cizicum</i> and <i>Mitylenæ?</i> The
fairest towns that ever the sun rose upon, are now no more; the
names only are left, and those (for many of them are wrong spelt)
are falling themselves by piece-meals to decay, and in length of
time will be forgotten, and involved with every thing in a
perpetual night: the world itself, brother <i>Toby</i>,
must—must come to an end.</p>

<p>“Returning out of <i>Asia</i>, when I sailed from
<i>Ægina</i> towards <i>Megara</i>,” (<i>when can this
have been? thought my uncle Toby</i>,) “I began to view
the country round about. <i>Ægina</i> was behind me,
<i>Megara</i> was before, <i>Pyræus</i> on the right hand,
<i>Corinth</i> on the left.—What flourishing towns now
prostrate upon the earth! Alas! alas! said I to myself, that man
should disturb his soul for the loss of a child, when so much as
this lies awfully buried in his presence——Remember,
said I to myself again—remember thou art a
man.”—</p>

<p>Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> knew not that this last paragraph was
an extract of <i>Servius Sulpicius</i>’s consolatory letter
to Tully.—He had as little skill, honest man, in the
fragments, as he had in the whole pieces of antiquity.—And as
my father, whilst he was concerned in the <i>Turkey</i> trade, had
been three or four different times in the <i>Levant</i>, in one of
which he had stayed a whole year and an half at <i>Zant</i>, my
uncle <i>Toby</i> naturally concluded, that, in some one of these
periods, he had taken a trip across the <i>Archipelago</i> into
<i>Asia;</i> and that all this sailing affair with
<i>Ægina</i> behind, and <i>Megara</i> before, and
<i>Pyræus</i> on the right hand, &amp;c. &amp;c. was nothing
more than the true course of my father’s voyage and
reflections.—’Twas certainly in his <i>manner</i>, and
many an undertaking critic would have built two stories higher upon
worse foundations.—And pray, brother, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, laying the end of his pipe upon my father’s hand
in a kindly way of interruption—but waiting till he finished
the account—what year of our Lord was this?—’Twas
no year of our Lord, replied my father.—That’s
impossible, cried my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Simpleton! said my
father,—’twas forty years before Christ was born.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> had but two things for it; either to
suppose his brother to be the wandering <i>Jew</i>, or that his
misfortunes had disordered his brain.—“May the
Lord God of heaven and earth protect him and restore him!”
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, praying silently for my father, and with
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>—My father placed the tears to a proper account, and went
on with his harangue with great spirit.</p>

<p>“There is not such great odds, brother <i>Toby</i>,
betwixt good and evil, as the world
imagines”——(this way of setting off, by the bye,
was not likely to cure my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
suspicions).——“Labour, sorrow, grief,
sickness, want, and woe, are the sauces of life.”—Much
good may do them—said my uncle <i>Toby</i> to
himself.——</p>

<p>“My son is dead!—so much the
better;—’tis a shame in such a tempest to have but one
anchor.</p>

<p>“But he is gone for ever from us!—be it so. He
is got from under the hands of his barber before he was
bald—he is but risen from a feast before he was
surfeited—from a banquet before he had got drunken.</p>

<p>“The <i>Thracians</i> wept when a child was
born,”—(and we were very near it, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,)—“and feasted and made merry when a man
went out of the world; and with reason.——Death opens
the gate of fame, and shuts the gate of envy after it,—it
unlooses the chain of the captive, and puts the bondsman’s
task into another man’s hands.</p>

<p>“Shew me the man, who knows what life is, who dreads
it, and I’ll shew thee a prisoner who dreads his
liberty.”</p>

<p>Is it not better, my dear brother <i>Toby</i>, (for
mark—our appetites are but diseases,)—is it not better
not to hunger at all, than to eat?—not to thirst, than to
take physic to cure it?</p>

<p>Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, from love and
melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than, like
a galled traveller, who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to
begin his journey afresh?</p>

<p>There is no terrour, brother <i>Toby</i>, in its looks, but what
it borrows from groans and convulsions—and the blowing of
noses and the wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains, in
a dying man’s room.—Strip it of these, what is
it?—’Tis better in battle than in bed, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>—Take away its hearses, its mutes, and its
mourning,—its plumes, scutcheons, and other mechanic
aids—What is it?—<i>Better in battle!</i> continued my
father, smiling, for he had absolutely forgot my brother
<i>Bobby</i>—’tis terrible no way—for consider,
brother <i>Toby</i>,—when we <i>are</i>—death is
<i>not;</i>—and when death <i>is</i>—we are <i>not.</i>
My uncle <i>Toby</i> laid down his pipe to consider the
proposition; my father’s eloquence was too rapid to stay for
any man—away it went,—and hurried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s ideas along with it.——</p>

<p>For this reason, continued my father, ’tis worthy to
recollect, how little alteration, in great men, the approaches of
death have made.—<i>Vespasian</i> died in a jest upon his
close-stool—<i>Galba</i> with a sentence—<i>Septimus
Severus</i> in a dispatch—<i>Tiberius</i> in dissimulation,
and <i>Cæsar Augustus</i> in a compliment.—I hope
’twas a sincere one—quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>—’Twas to his wife,—said my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IV</small>
</h3>

<p>——And lastly—for all the choice
anecdotes which history can produce of this matter, continued my
father,—this, like the gilded dome which covers in the
fabric—crowns all.—</p>

<p>’Tis of <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>, the
prætor—which, I dare say, brother <i>Toby</i>, you have
read.—I dare say I have not, replied my uncle.—He died,
said my father as * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * —And if it
was with his wife, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>—there could be no
hurt in it.—That’s more than I know—replied my
father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;V</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> mother was going very gingerly in
the dark along the passage which led to the parlour, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> pronounced the word <i>wife.</i>—’Tis a
shrill penetrating sound of itself, and <i>Obadiah</i> had helped
it by leaving the door a little a-jar, so that my mother heard
enough of it to imagine herself the subject of the conversation; so
laying the edge of her finger across her two lips—holding in
her breath, and bending her head a little downwards, with a twist
of her neck—(not towards the door, but from it, by which
means her ear was brought to the chink)—she listened with all
her powers:——the listening slave, with the Goddess of
Silence at his back, could not have given a finer thought for an
intaglio.</p>

<p>In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five
minutes: till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen (as
<i>Rapin</i> does those of the church) to the same period.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> in one sense, our family was
certainly a simple machine, as it consisted of a few wheels; yet
there was thus much to be said for it, that these wheels were set
in motion by so many different springs, and acted one upon the
other from such a variety of strange principles and
impulses——that though it was a simple machine, it had
all the honour and advantages of a complex one,——and a
number of as odd movements within it, as ever were beheld in the
inside of a <i>Dutch</i> silk-mill.</p>

<p>Amongst these there was one, I am going to speak of, in which,
perhaps, it was not altogether so singular, as in many others; and
it was this, that whatever motion, debate, harangue, dialogue, project, or dissertation, was going forwards in the
parlour, there was generally another at the same time, and upon the
same subject, running parallel along with it in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Now to bring this about, whenever an extraordinary message, or
letter, was delivered in the parlour—or a discourse suspended
till a servant went out—or the lines of discontent were
observed to hang upon the brows of my father or mother—or, in
short, when any thing was supposed to be upon the tapis worth
knowing or listening to, ’twas the rule to leave the door,
not absolutely shut, but somewhat a-jar—as it stands just
now,—which, under covert of the bad hinge, (and that possibly
might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended,) it was
not difficult to manage; by which means, in all these cases, a
passage was generally left, not indeed as wide as the
<i>Dardanelles</i>, but wide enough, for all that, to carry on as
much of this windward trade, as was sufficient to save my father
the trouble of governing his house;—my mother at this moment stands
profiting by it.—<i>Obadiah</i> did the same thing, as soon
as he had left the letter upon the table which brought the news of
my brother’s death, so that before my father had well got
over his surprise, and entered upon his harangue,—had
<i>Trim</i> got upon his legs, to speak his sentiments upon the
subject.</p>

<p>A curious observer of nature, had he been worth the inventory of
all <i>Job</i>’s stock—though by the bye, <i>your
curious observers are seldom worth a groat</i>—would have
given the half of it, to have heard Corporal <i>Trim</i> and my
father, two orators so contrasted by nature and education,
haranguing over the same bier.</p>

<p>My father—a man of deep reading—prompt
memory—with <i>Cato</i>, and <i>Seneca</i>, and
<i>Epictetus</i>, at his fingers ends.—</p>

<p>The corporal—with nothing—to remember—of no
deeper reading than his muster-roll—or greater names at his
fingers end, than the contents of it.</p>

<p>The one proceeding from period to period, by metaphor and
allusion, and striking the fancy as he went along (as men of wit
and fancy do) with the entertainment and pleasantry of his pictures
and images.</p>

<p>The other, without wit or antithesis, or point, or turn, this
way or that; but leaving the images on one side, and the picture on
the other, going straight forwards as nature could lead him, to the
heart. O <i>Trim!</i> would to heaven thou had’st a better
historian!—would!—thy historian had a better pair of
breeches!——O ye critics! will nothing melt you?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VII</small>
</h3>

<p>——My young master in London is dead?
said <i>Obadiah.</i>—</p>

<p>——A green sattin night-gown of my mother’s,
which had been twice scoured, was the first idea which
<i>Obadiah</i>’s exclamation brought into
<i>Susannah</i>’s head.</p>

<p>—Well might <i>Locke</i> write a chapter upon the
imperfections of words.—Then, quoth <i>Susannah</i>, we must
all go into mourning.—But note a second time: the word
<i>mourning</i>, notwithstanding <i>Susannah</i> made use of it
herself—failed also of doing its office; it excited not one
single idea, tinged either with grey or black,—all was
green.——The green sattin night-gown hung there
still.</p>

<p>—O! ’twill be the death of my poor mistress, cried
<i>Susannah.</i>—My mother’s whole wardrobe
followed.—What a procession! her red damask,—her orange
tawney,—her white and yellow lutestrings,—her brown
taffata,—her bone-laced caps, her bed-gowns, and comfortable
under-petticoats.—Not a rag was left
behind.—“<i>No,—she will never look up
again</i>,” said <i>Susannah.</i></p>

<p>We had a fat, foolish scullion—my father, I think, kept
her for her simplicity;—she had been all autumn struggling
with a dropsy.—He is dead, said <i>Obadiah</i>,—he is
certainly dead!—So am not I, said the foolish scullion.</p>

<p>——Here is sad news, <i>Trim</i>, cried
<i>Susannah</i>, wiping her eyes as <i>Trim</i> stepp’d into
the kitchen,—master <i>Bobby</i> is dead and
<i>buried</i>—the funeral was an interpolation of
<i>Susannah</i>’s—we shall have all to go into
mourning, said <i>Susannah.</i></p>

<p>I hope not, said <i>Trim.</i>—You hope not! cried
<i>Susannah</i> earnestly.—The mourning ran not in
<i>Trim</i>’s head, whatever it did in
<i>Susannah</i>’s.—I hope—said <i>Trim</i>,
explaining himself, I hope in God the news is not true. I heard the
letter read with my own ears, answered <i>Obadiah;</i> and we shall
have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the
ox-moor.—Oh! he’s dead, said <i>Susannah.</i>—As
sure, said the scullion, as I’m alive.</p>

<p>I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said <i>Trim</i>,
fetching a sigh.—Poor creature!—poor boy!—poor
gentleman!</p>

<p>—He was alive last <i>Whitsontide!</i> said the
coachman.—<i>Whitsontide!</i> alas! cried <i>Trim</i>,
extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he
read the sermon,—what is <i>Whitsontide, Jonathan</i> (for
that was the coachman’s name), or <i>Shrovetide</i>, or any
tide or time past, to this? Are we not here now, continued the
corporal (striking the end of his stick perpendicularly upon the
floor, so as to give an idea of health and stability)—and are
we not—(dropping his hat upon the ground) gone! in a
moment!—’Twas infinitely striking! <i>Susannah</i>
burst into a flood of tears.—We are not stocks and
stones.—<i>Jonathan, Obadiah</i>, the cook-maid, all
melted.—The foolish fat scullion herself, who was scouring a
fish-kettle upon her knees, was rous’d with it.—The
whole kitchen crowded about the corporal.</p>

<p>Now, as I perceive plainly, that the preservation of our
constitution in church and state,—and possibly the
preservation of the whole world—or what is the same thing,
the distribution and balance of its property and power, may in time
to come depend greatly upon the right understanding of this stroke of the corporal’s
eloquence—I do demand your attention—your worships and
reverences, for any ten pages together, take them where you will in
any other part of the work, shall sleep for it at your ease.</p>

<p>I said, “we were not stocks and
stones”—’tis very well. I should have added, nor
are we angels, I wish we were,—but men clothed with bodies,
and governed by our imaginations;—and what a junketing piece
of work of it there is, betwixt these and our seven senses,
especially some of them, for my own part, I own it, I am ashamed to
confess. Let it suffice to affirm, that of all the senses, the eye
(for I absolutely deny the touch, though most of your
<i>Barbati</i>, I know, are for it) has the quickest commerce with
the soul,—gives a smarter stroke, and leaves something more
inexpressible upon the fancy, than words can either convey—or
sometimes get rid of.</p>

<p>—I’ve gone a little about—no matter,
’tis for health—let us only carry it back in our mind
to the mortality of <i>Trim</i>’s hat—“Are we not
here now,—and gone in a moment?”—There was
nothing in the sentence—’twas one of your self-evident
truths we have the advantage of hearing every day; and if
<i>Trim</i> had not trusted more to his hat than his head—he
made nothing at all of it.</p>

<p>——“Are we not here now;” continued the
corporal, “and are we not”—(dropping his hat
plumb upon the ground—and pausing, before he pronounced the
word)—“gone! in a moment?” The descent of
the hat was as if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the
crown of it.——Nothing could have expressed the
sentiment of mortality, of which it was the type and fore-runner,
like it,—his hand seemed to vanish from under it,—it
fell dead,—the corporal’s eye fixed upon it, as upon a
corpse,—and <i>Susannah</i> burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Now—Ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand (for
matter and motion are infinite) are the ways by which a hat may be
dropped upon the ground, without any effect.——Had he
flung it, or thrown it, or cast it, or skimmed it, or squirted it,
or let it slip or fall in any possible direction under
heaven,—or in the best direction that could be given to
it,—had he dropped it like a goose—like a
puppy—like an ass—or in doing it, or even after he had
done, had he looked like a fool—like a ninny—like a
nincompoop—it had fail’d, and the effect upon the heart
had been lost.</p>

<p>Ye who govern this mighty world and its mighty concerns with the
engines of eloquence,—who heat it, and cool it, and melt it,
and mollify it,——and then harden it again to <i>your
purpose</i>——</p>

<p>Ye who wind and turn the passions with this great windlass, and,
having done it, lead the owners of them, whither ye think meet.</p>

<p>Ye, lastly, who drive——and why not, Ye also who are
driven, like turkeys to market with a stick and a red
clout—meditate—meditate, I beseech you, upon
<i>Trim</i>’s hat.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VIII</small>
</h3>

<p>S<small>TAY</small>—I have a small account to
settle with the reader before <i>Trim</i> can go on with his
harangue.—It shall be done in two minutes.</p>

<p>Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in
due time,—I own myself a debtor to the world for two
items,—a chapter upon <i>chamber-maids and button-holes</i>,
which, in the former part of my work, I promised and fully intended
to pay off this year: but some of your worships and reverences
telling me, that the two subjects, especially so connected
together, might endanger the morals of the world,—I pray the
chapter upon chamber-maids and button-holes may be forgiven
me,—and that they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it; which is nothing, an’t
please your reverences, but a chapter of <i>chamber-maids, green
gowns, and old hats.</i></p>

<p><i>Trim</i> took his hat off the ground,—put it upon his
head,—and then went on with his oration upon death, in manner
and form following.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IX</small>
</h3>

<p>——To us, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know not
what want or care is—who live here in the service of two of
the best of masters—(bating in my own case his majesty King
<i>William</i> the Third, whom I had the honour to serve both in
<i>Ireland</i> and <i>Flanders</i>)—I own it, that from
<i>Whitsontide</i> to within three weeks of
<i>Christmas</i>,—’tis not long—’tis like
nothing;—but to those, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know what death
is, and what havock and destruction he can make, before a man can
well wheel about—’tis like a whole age.—O
<i>Jonathan!</i> ’twould make a good-natured man’s
heart bleed, to consider, continued the corporal (standing perpendicularly),
how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that
time!—And trust me, <i>Susy</i>, added the corporal, turning
to <i>Susannah</i>, whose eyes were swimming in water,—before
that time comes round again,—many a bright eye will be
dim.—<i>Susannah</i> placed it to the right side of the
page—she wept—but she court’sied too.—Are
we not, continued <i>Trim</i>, looking still at
<i>Susannah</i>—are we not like a flower of the field—a
tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of
humiliation—else no tongue could have described
<i>Susannah</i>’s affliction—is not all flesh
grass?—Tis clay,—’tis dirt.—They all looked
directly at the scullion,—the scullion had just been scouring
a fish-kettle.—It was not fair.—</p>

<p>—What is the finest face that ever man looked at!—I
could hear <i>Trim</i> talk so for ever, cried
<i>Susannah</i>,—what is it! (<i>Susannah</i> laid her hand
upon <i>Trim</i>’s shoulder)—but
corruption?——<i>Susannah</i> took it off.</p>

<p>Now I love you for this—and ’tis this delicious
mixture within you which makes you dear creatures what you
are—and he who hates you for it——all I can say of
the matter is—That he has either a pumpkin for his
head—or a pippin for his heart,—and whenever he is
dissected ’twill be found so.</p>

<p>W<small>HETHER</small> <i>Susannah</i>, by taking
her hand too suddenly from off the corporal’s shoulder (by
the whisking about of her passions)——broke a little the
chain of his reflexions——</p>

<p>Or whether the corporal began to be suspicious, he had got into
the doctor’s quarters, and was talking more like the chaplain
than himself——</p>

<p>Or whether &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;-
&nbsp;- &nbsp;- Or whether——for in all such cases a man
of invention and parts may with pleasure fill a couple of pages
with suppositions——which of all these was the cause,
let the curious physiologist, or the curious any body
determine——’tis certain, at least, the corporal
went on thus with his harangue.</p>

<p>For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not
death at all:—not this . . added the corporal, snapping his
fingers,—but with an air which no one but the corporal could
have given to the sentiment.—In battle, I value death not
this . . . and let him not take me cowardly, like poor <i>Joe
Gibbins</i>, in scouring his gun.—What is he? A pull of a
trigger—a push of a bayonet an inch this way or
that—makes the difference.—Look along the line—to
the right—see! <i>Jack</i>’s down!
well,—’tis worth a regiment of horse to
him.—No—’tis <i>Dick.</i> Then
<i>Jack</i>’s no worse.—Never mind which,—we pass
on,—in hot pursuit the wound itself which brings him is not
felt,—the best way is to stand up to him,—the man who
flies, is in ten times more danger than the man who marches up into
his jaws.—I’ve look’d him, added the corporal, an
hundred times in the face,—and know what he
is.—He’s nothing, <i>Obadiah</i>, at all in the
field.—But he’s very frightful in a house, quoth
<i>Obadiah.</i>——I never mind it myself, said
<i>Jonathan</i>, upon a coach-box.—It must, in my opinion, be
most natural in bed, replied <i>Susannah.</i>—And could I
escape him by creeping into the worst calf’s skin that ever
was made into a knapsack, I would do it there—said
<i>Trim</i>—but that is nature.</p>

<p>——Nature is nature, said <i>Jonathan.</i>—And
that is the reason, cried <i>Susannah</i>, I so much pity my
mistress.—She will never get the better of it.—Now I
pity the captain the most of any one in the family, answered
<i>Trim.</i>——Madam will get ease of heart in
weeping,—and the Squire in talking about it,—but my
poor master will keep it all in silence to himself.—I shall
hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month together, as he did for
lieutenant <i>Le Fever.</i> An’ please your honour, do not
sigh so piteously, I would say to him as I laid besides him. I
cannot help it, <i>Trim</i>, my master would say,—’tis
so melancholy an accident—I cannot get it off my heart.—Your honour fears not death
yourself.—I hope, <i>Trim</i>, I fear nothing, he would say,
but the doing a wrong thing.——Well, he would add,
whatever betides, I will take care of <i>Le Fever</i>’s
boy.—And with that, like a quieting draught, his honour would
fall asleep.</p>

<p>I like to hear <i>Trim</i>’s stories about the captain,
said <i>Susannah.</i>—He is a kindly-hearted gentleman, said
<i>Obadiah</i>, as ever lived.—Aye, and as brave a one too,
said the corporal, as ever stept before a platoon.—There
never was a better officer in the king’s army,—or a
better man in God’s world; for he would march up to the mouth
of a cannon, though he saw the lighted match at the very
touch-hole,—and yet, for all that, he has a heart as soft as
a child for other people.——He would not hurt a
chicken.——I would sooner, quoth <i>Jonathan</i>, drive
such a gentleman for seven pounds a year—than some for
eight.—Thank thee, <i>Jonathan!</i> for thy twenty
shillings,—as much, <i>Jonathan</i>, said the corporal,
shaking him by the hand, as if thou hadst put the money into my own
pocket.——I would serve him to the day of my death out
of love. He is a friend and a brother to me,—and could I be
sure my poor brother <i>Tom</i> was dead,—continued the
corporal, taking out his handkerchief,—was I worth ten
thousand pounds, I would leave every shilling of it to the
captain.——<i>Trim</i> could not refrain from tears at
this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his
master.——The whole kitchen was affected.—Do tell
us the story of the poor lieutenant, said
<i>Susannah.</i>——With all my heart, answered the
corporal.</p>

<p><i>Susannah</i>, the cook, <i>Jonathan</i>, <i>Obadiah</i>, and
corporal <i>Trim</i>, formed a circle about the fire; and as soon
as the scullion had shut the kitchen door,—the corporal
begun.</p>

<p>I <small>AM</small> a <i>Turk</i> if I had not as
much forgot my mother, as if Nature had plaistered me up, and set
me down naked upon the banks of the river <i>Nile</i>, without
one.——Your most obedient servant,
Madam—I’ve cost you a great deal of trouble,—I
wish it may answer;—but you have left a crack in my
back,—and here’s a great piece fallen off here
before,—and what must I do with this foot?——I
shall never reach <i>England</i> with it.</p>

<p>For my own part, I never wonder at any thing;—and so often
has my judgment deceived me in my life, that I always suspect it,
right or wrong,—at least I am seldom hot upon cold subjects.
For all this, I reverence truth as much as any body; and when it
has slipped us, if a man will but take me by the hand, and go
quietly and search for it, as for a thing we have both lost, and
can neither of us do well without,—I’ll go to the world’s end with
him:——But I hate disputes,—and therefore (bating
religious points, or such as touch society) I would almost
subscribe to any thing which does not choak me in the first
passage, rather than be drawn into one——But I cannot
bear suffocation,——and bad smells worst of
all.——For which reasons, I resolved from the beginning,
That if ever the army of martyrs was to be augmented,—or a

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>——B<small>UT</small> to return to my
mother.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>’s opinion, Madam, “that
there could be no harm in <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>, the <i>Roman</i>
prætor’s lying with his wife;”——or
rather the last word of that opinion,—(for it was all my
mother heard of it) caught hold of her by the weak part of the
whole sex:——You shall not mistake me,—I mean her curiosity,—she instantly concluded herself
the subject of the conversation, and with that prepossession upon
her fancy, you will readily conceive every word my father said, was
accommodated either to herself, or her family concerns.</p>

<p>——Pray, Madam, in what street does the lady live,
who would not have done the same?</p>

<p>
From the strange mode of <i>Cornelius</i>’s death, my father had made a
transition to that of <i>Socrates</i>, and was giving my uncle <i>Toby</i> an
abstract of his pleading before his judges;——’twas
irresistible:——not the oration of <i>Socrates</i>,—but my
father’s temptation to it.——He had wrote the Life of
<i>Socrates</i><a href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> himself the year before he left off
trade, which, I fear, was the means of hastening him out of it;——so
that no one was able to set out with so full a sail, and in so swelling a tide
of heroic loftiness upon the occasion, as my father was. Not a period in
<i>Socrates</i>’s oration, which closed with a shorter word than
<i>transmigration</i>, or <i>annihilation</i>,—or a worse thought in the
middle of it than <i>to be—or not to be</i>,—the entering upon a
new and untried state of things,—or, upon a long, a profound and peaceful
sleep, without dreams, without disturbance?——<i>That we and our
children were born to die,—but neither of us born to be
slaves.</i>——No—there I mistake; that was part of
<i>Eleazer</i>’s oration, as recorded by <i>Josephus (de Bell.
Judaic)</i>——<i>Eleazer</i> owns he had it from the philosophers of
<i>India;</i> in all likelihood <i>Alexander</i> the Great, in his irruption
into <i>India</i>, after he had over-run <i>Persia</i>, amongst the many things
he stole,—stole that sentiment also; by which means it was carried, if
not all the way by himself (for we all know he died at <i>Babylon</i>), at
least by some of his maroders, into <i>Greece</i>,—from <i>Greece</i> it
got to <i>Rome</i>,—from <i>Rome</i> to <i>France</i>,—and from
<i>France</i> to <i>England:</i>——So things come
round.——
</p>

<p>By land carriage, I can conceive no other way.——</p>

<p>By water the sentiment might easily have come down the
<i>Ganges</i> into the <i>Sinus Gangeticus</i>, or <i>Bay of
Bengal</i>, and so into the <i>Indian Sea;</i> and following the
course of trade (the way from <i>India</i> by the <i>Cape of Good
Hope</i> being then unknown), might be carried with other drugs and
spices up the <i>Red Sea</i> to <i>Joddah</i>, the port of
<i>Mekka</i>, or else to <i>Tor</i> or <i>Sues</i>, towns at the
bottom of the gulf; and from thence by karrawans to <i>Coptos</i>,
but three days journey distant, so down the <i>Nile</i> directly to
<i>Alexandria</i>, where the <small>SENTIMENT</small> would be
landed at the very foot of the great stair-case of the
<i>Alexandrian</i> library,——and from that store-house
it would be fetched.——Bless me! what a trade was driven
by the learned in those days!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——N<small>OW</small> my father had a
way, a little like that of <i>Job</i>’s (in case there ever
was such a man——if not, there’s an end of the
matter.——</p>

<p>Though, by the bye, because your learned men find some
difficulty in fixing the precise æra in which so great a man
lived;—whether, for instance, before or after the patriarchs,
&amp;c.——to vote, therefore, that he never lived at
all, is a little cruel,—’tis not doing as they would be
done by,—happen that as it may)——My father, I
say, had a way, when things went extremely wrong with him,
especially upon the first sally of his impatience,—of
wondering why he was begot,—wishing himself
dead;—sometimes worse:——And when the provocation
ran high, and grief touched his lips with more than ordinary
powers—Sir, you scarce could have distinguished him from
<i>Socrates</i> himself.——Every word would breathe the
sentiments of a soul disdaining life, and careless about all its issues; for which reason,
though my mother was a woman of no deep reading, yet the abstract
of <i>Socrates</i>’s oration, which my father was giving my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, was not altogether new to her.—She
listened to it with composed intelligence, and would have done so
to the end of the chapter, had not my father plunged (which he had
no occasion to have done) into that part of the pleading where the
great philosopher reckons up his connections, his alliances, and
children; but renounces a security to be so won by working upon the
passions of his judges.—“I have friends—I
have relations,—I have three desolate
children,”—says <i>Socrates.</i>—</p>

<p>——Then, cried my mother, opening the
door,——you have one more, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, than I
know of.</p>

<p>By heaven! I have one less,—said my father, getting up and
walking out of the room.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>——T<small>HEY</small> are
<i>Socrates</i>’s children, said my uncle <i>Toby.</i> He has
been dead a hundred years ago, replied my mother.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> was no chronologer—so not caring to
advance one step but upon safe ground, he laid down his pipe
deliberately upon the table, and rising up, and taking my mother
most kindly by the hand, without saying another word, either good
or bad, to her, he led her out after my father, that he might
finish the ecclaircissement himself.</p>

<p>H<small>AD</small> this volume been a farce, which,
unless every one’s life and opinions are to be looked upon as
a farce as well as mine, I see no reason to suppose—the last
chapter, Sir, had finished the first act of it, and then this
chapter must have set off thus.</p>

&nbsp;ing—twing—twang—prut—trut——’tis
a cursed bad fiddle.—Do you know whether my fiddle’s in tune or
no?—trut&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;prut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;—
They should be <i>fifths.</i>——’Tis wickedly
strung—tr&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a&nbsp;.&nbsp;e&nbsp;.&nbsp;i&nbsp;.&nbsp;o&nbsp;.&nbsp;u&nbsp;.-twang.—The
bridge is a mile too high, and the sound post absolutely
down,—else—trut . . prut—hark! tis not so bad a
tone.—Diddle diddle, diddle diddle, diddle diddle, dum. There is nothing
in playing before good judges,—but there’s a man
there—no—not him with the bundle under his arm—the grave man
in black.—’Sdeath! not the gentleman with the sword on.—Sir,
I had rather play a <i>Caprichio</i> to <i>Calliope</i> herself, than draw my
bow across my fiddle before that very man; and yet I’ll stake my
<i>Cremona</i> to a <i>Jew</i>’s trump, which is the greatest musical
odds that ever were laid, that I will this moment stop three hundred and fifty
leagues out of tune upon my fiddle, without punishing one single nerve that
belongs to him—Twaddle diddle, tweddle diddle,—twiddle
diddle,—twoddle diddle,—twuddle diddle,——prut
trut—krish—krash—krush.—I’ve undone you,
Sir,—but you see he’s no worse,—and was <i>Apollo</i> to take
his fiddle after me, he can make him no better.
</p>

<p>Diddle diddle, diddle diddle, diddle
diddle—hum—dum—drum.</p>

<p>—Your worships and your reverences love music—and
God has made you all with good ears—and some of you play
delightfully yourselves—trut-prut,—prut-trut.</p>

<p>O! there is—whom I could sit and hear whole
days,—whose talents lie in making what he fiddles to be
felt,—who inspires me with his joys and hopes, and puts the
most hidden springs of my heart into motion.—If you would
borrow five guineas of me, Sir,—which is generally ten
guineas more than I have to spare—or you Messrs. Apothecary
and Taylor, want your bills paying,—that’s your
time.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> first thing which entered my
father’s head, after affairs were a little settled in the
family, and <i>Susanna</i> had got possession of my mother’s
green sattin night-gown,—was to sit down coolly, after the
example of <i>Xenophon</i>, and write a
T<small>RISTRA</small>-<i>pædia</i>, or system of education
for me; collecting first for that purpose his own scattered
thoughts, counsels, and notions; and binding them together, so as
to form an <small>INSTITUTE</small> for the government of my
childhood and adolescence. I was my father’s last
stake—he had lost my brother <i>Bobby</i> entirely,—he
had lost, by his own computation, full three-fourths of
me—that is, he had been unfortunate in his three first great
casts for me—my geniture, nose, and name,—there was but
this one left; and accordingly my father gave himself up to it with
as much devotion as ever my uncle <i>Toby</i> had done to his
doctrine of projectils.—The difference between them was, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> drew his whole
knowledge of projectils from <i>Nicholas Tartaglia</i>—My
father spun his, every thread of it, out of his own brain,—or
reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and spinsters had
spun before him, that ’twas pretty near the same torture to
him.</p>

<p>In about three years, or something more, my father had got
advanced almost into the middle of his work.—Like all other
writers, he met with disappointments.—He imagined he should
be able to bring whatever he had to say, into so small a compass,
that when it was finished and bound, it might be rolled up in my
mother’s hussive.—Matter grows under our
hands.—Let no man
say,—“Come—I’ll write a
duodecimo.”</p>

<p>My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful
diligence, proceeding step by step in every line, with the same
kind of caution and circumspection (though I cannot say upon quite
so religious a principle) as was used by <i>John de la Casse</i>,
the lord archbishop of <i>Benevento</i>, in compassing his
<i>Galatea;</i> in which his Grace of <i>Benevento</i> spent near
forty years of his life; and when the thing came out, it was not of
above half the size or the thickness of a <i>Rider</i>’s
Almanack.—How the holy man managed the affair, unless he
spent the greatest part of his time in combing his whiskers, or
playing at <i>primero</i> with his chaplain,—would pose any
mortal not let into the true secret;—and therefore ’tis
worth explaining to the world, was it only for the encouragement of
those few in it, who write not so much to be fed—as to be
famous.</p>

<p>I own had <i>John de la Casse</i>, the archbishop of
<i>Benevento</i>, for whose memory (notwithstanding his
<i>Galatea</i>,) I retain the highest veneration,—had he
been, Sir, a slender clerk—of dull wit—slow
parts—costive head, and so forth,—he and his
<i>Galatea</i> might have jogged on together to the age of
<i>Methuselah</i> for me,—the phænomenon had not been
worth a parenthesis.—</p>

<p>But the reverse of this was the truth: <i>John de la Casse</i>
was a genius of fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all
these great advantages of nature, which should have pricked him
forwards with his <i>Galatea</i>, he lay under an impuissance at
the same time of advancing above a line and a half in the compass
of a whole summer’s day: this disability in his Grace arose
from an opinion he was afflicted with,—which opinion was
this,—<i>viz.</i> that whenever a Christian was writing a
book (not for his private amusement, but) where his intent and
purpose was, <i>bonâ fide</i>, to print and publish it to the
world, his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil
one.—This was the state of ordinary writers: but when a
personage of venerable character and high station, either in church
or state, once turned author,—he maintained, that from the
very moment he took pen in hand—all the devils in hell broke
out of their holes to cajole him.—’Twas Term-time with
them,—every thought, first and last, was captious;—how specious and
good soever,—’twas all one;—in whatever form or
colour it presented itself to the imagination,—’twas
still a stroke of one or other of ’em levell’d at him,
and was to be fenced off.—So that the life of a writer,
whatever he might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of
<i>composition</i>, as a state of <i>warfare;</i> and his probation
in it, precisely that of any other man militant upon
earth,—both depending alike, not half so much upon the
degrees of his wit—as his <small>RESISTANCE</small>.</p>

<p>My father was hugely pleased with this theory of <i>John de la
Casse</i>, archbishop of <i>Benevento;</i> and (had it not cramped
him a little in his creed) I believe would have given ten of the
best acres in the <i>Shandy</i> estate, to have been the broacher
of it.—How far my father actually believed in the devil, will
be seen, when I come to speak of my father’s religious
notions, in the progress of this work: ’tis enough to say
here, as he could not have the honour of it, in the literal sense of the doctrine—he took
up with the allegory of it; and would often say, especially when
his pen was a little retrograde, there was as much good meaning,
truth, and knowledge, couched under the veil of <i>John de la
Casse</i>’s parabolical representation,—as was to be
found in any one poetic fiction or mystic record of
antiquity.—Prejudice of education, he would say, <i>is the
devil</i>,—and the multitudes of them which we suck in with
our mother’s milk—<i>are the devil and
all.</i>——We are haunted with them, brother
<i>Toby</i>, in all our lucubrations and researches; and was a man
fool enough to submit tamely to what they obtruded upon
him,—what would his book be? Nothing,—he would add,
throwing his pen away with a vengeance,—nothing but a farrago
of the clack of nurses, and of the nonsense of the old women (of
both sexes) throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow
progress my father made in his <i>Tristra-pædia;</i> at
which (as I said) he was three years, and something more,
indefatigably at work, and, at last, had scarce completed, by this
own reckoning, one half of his undertaking: the misfortune was,
that I was all that time totally neglected and abandoned to my
mother; and what was almost as bad, by the very delay, the first
part of the work, upon which my father had spent the most of his
pains, was rendered entirely useless,——every day a page
or two became of no consequence.——</p>

<p>——Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the
pride of human wisdom, That the wisest of us all should thus outwit
ourselves, and eternally forego our purposes in the intemperate act
of pursuing them.</p>

<p>In short my father was so long in all his acts of
resistance,—or in other words,—he advanced so very slow
with his work, and I began to live and get forwards at such a rate,
that if an event had not happened,——which, when we get
to it, if it can be told with decency, shall not be concealed a moment from the
reader——I verily believe, I had put by my father, and
left him drawing a sundial, for no better purpose than to be buried
under ground.</p>

<p>——’T<small>WAS</small>
nothing,—I did not lose two drops of blood by
it——’twas not worth calling in a surgeon, had he
lived next door to us——thousands suffer by choice, what
I did by accident.——Doctor <i>Slop</i> made ten times
more of it, than there was occasion:——some men rise, by
the art of hanging great weights upon small wires,—and I am
this day (<i>August</i> the 10th, 1761) paying part of the price of
this man’s reputation.——O ’twould provoke a
stone, to see how things are carried on in this
world!——The chamber-maid had left no ******* *** under
the bed:——Cannot you contrive, master, quoth
<i>Susannah</i>, lifting up the sash with one hand, as she spoke,
and helping me up into the window-seat with the
other,—cannot you manage, my dear, for a single time, to ****
*** ** *** ****** ?</p>

<p>I was five years old.——<i>Susannah</i> did not
consider that nothing was well hung in our family,——so
slap came the sash down like lightning upon us;—Nothing is
left,—cried <i>Susannah</i>,—nothing is left—for
me, but to run my country.——</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>’s house was a much kinder sanctuary;
and so <i>Susannah</i> fled to it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> <i>Susannah</i> told the
corporal the misadventure of the sash, with all the circumstances
which attended the <i>murder</i> of me,—(as she called
it,)—the blood forsook his cheeks,—all accessaries in
murder being principals,—<i>Trim</i>’s conscience told
him he was as much to blame as <i>Susannah</i>,—and if the
doctrine had been true, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had as much of the bloodshed to answer for to
heaven, as either of ’em;—so that neither reason or
instinct, separate or together, could possibly have guided
<i>Susannah</i>’s steps to so proper an asylum. It is in vain
to leave this to the Reader’s imagination:——to
form any kind of hypothesis that will render these propositions
feasible, he must cudgel his brains sore,—and to do it
without,—he must have such brains as no reader ever had
before him.—Why should I put them either to trial or to
torture? ’Tis my own affair: I’ll explain it
myself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIX</small>
</h3>

<p>’T<small>IS</small> a pity, <i>Trim</i>, said
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, resting with his hand upon the
corporal’s shoulder, as they both stood surveying their
works,—that we have not a couple of field-pieces to mount in
the gorge of that new redoubt;—’twould secure the lines
all along there, and make the attack on that side quite
complete:——get me a couple cast, <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>Your honour shall have them, replied <i>Trim</i>, before
tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>It was the joy of <i>Trim</i>’s heart, nor was his fertile
head ever at a loss for expedients in doing it, to supply my uncle
<i>Toby</i> in his campaigns, with whatever his fancy called for;
had it been his last crown, he would have sate down and hammered it
into a paderero, to have prevented a single wish in his master. The
corporal had already,—what with cutting off the ends of my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s spouts—hacking and chiseling up the
sides of his leaden gutters,—melting down his pewter
shaving-bason,—and going at last, like <i>Lewis</i> the
Fourteenth, on to the top of the church, for spare ends,
&amp;c.——he had that very campaign brought no less than
eight new battering cannons, besides three demi-culverins, into the
field; my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s demand for two more pieces for
the redoubt, had set the corporal at work again; and no better resource offering, he had taken
the two leaden weights from the nursery window: and as the sash
pullies, when the lead was gone, were of no kind of use, he had
taken them away also, to make a couple of wheels for one of their
carriages.</p>

<p>He had dismantled every sash-window in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s house long before, in the very same
way,—though not always in the same order; for sometimes the
pullies have been wanted, and not the lead,—so then he began
with the pullies,—and the pullies being picked out, then the
lead became useless,—and so the lead went to pot too.</p>

<p>——A great <small>MORAL</small> might be picked
handsomely out of this, but I have not time—’tis enough
to say, wherever the demolition began, ’twas equally fatal to
the sash window.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> corporal had not taken his
measures so badly in this stroke of artilleryship, but that he
might have kept the matter entirely to himself, and left
<i>Susannah</i> to have sustained the whole weight of the attack,
as she could;—true courage is not content with coming off
so.——The corporal, whether as general or comptroller of
the train,—’twas no matter,——had done that,
without which, as he imagined, the misfortune could never have
happened,—<i>at least in</i> Susannah<i>’s
hands;</i>——How would your honours have
behaved?——He determined at once, not to take shelter
behind <i>Susannah</i>,—but to give it; and with this
resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the parlour, to
lay the whole <i>manœuvre</i> before my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> had just then been giving <i>Yorick</i> an
account of the Battle of <i>Steenkirk</i>, and of the strange
conduct of count <i>Solmes</i> in ordering the foot to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which
was directly contrary to the king’s commands, and proved the
loss of the day.</p>

<p>There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of
what is going to follow,—they are scarce exceeded by the
invention of a dramatic writer;—I mean of ancient
days.——</p>

<p><i>Trim</i>, by the help of his fore-finger, laid flat upon the
table, and the edge of his hand striking across it at right angles,
made a shift to tell his story so, that priests and virgins might
have listened to it;—and the story being told,—the
dialogue went on as follows.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXI</small>
</h3>

<p>——I would be picquetted to death, cried
the corporal, as he concluded <i>Susannah</i>’s story, before
I would suffer the woman to come to any harm,—’twas my
fault, an’ please your honour,—not her’s.</p>

<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, putting on
his hat which lay upon the table,——if any thing can be said to be a
fault, when the service absolutely requires it should be
done,—’tis I certainly who deserve the blame,—you
obeyed your orders.</p>

<p>Had count <i>Solmes</i>, <i>Trim</i>, done the same at the
battle of <i>Steenkirk</i>, said <i>Yorick</i>, drolling a little
upon the corporal, who had been run over by a dragoon in the
retreat,——he had saved thee;——Saved! cried
<i>Trim</i>, interrupting <i>Yorick</i>, and finishing the sentence
for him after his own fashion,——he had saved five
battalions, an’ please your reverence, every soul of
them:——there was
<i>Cutt</i>&nbsp;’s,—continued the corporal, clapping
the forefinger of his right hand upon the thumb of his left, and
counting round his hand,——there was
<i>Cutt&nbsp;</i>’s,——<i>Mackay&nbsp;</i>’s,——<i>Angus&nbsp;</i>’s,——<i>Graham&nbsp;</i>’s,——and
<i>Leven&nbsp;</i>’s, all cut to pieces;——and so
had the <i>English</i> life-guards too, had it not been for some
regiments upon the right, who marched up boldly to their relief,
and received the enemy’s fire in their faces, before any one
of their own platoons discharged a
musket,——they’ll go to heaven for it,—added
<i>Trim.</i>—<i>Trim</i> is right, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, nodding to <i>Yorick</i>,——he’s
perfectly right. What signified his marching the horse, continued
the corporal, where the ground was so strait, that the
<i>French</i> had such a nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches,
and fell’d trees laid this way and that to cover them (as
they always have).——Count <i>Solmes</i> should have
sent us,——we would have fired muzzle to muzzle with
them for their lives.——There was nothing to be done for
the horse:——he had his foot shot off however for his
pains, continued the corporal, the very next campaign at
<i>Landen.</i>—Poor <i>Trim</i> got his wound there, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby.</i>——’Twas owing, an’ please
your honour, entirely to count <i>Solmes</i>,——had he
drubbed them soundly at <i>Steenkirk</i>, they would not have
fought us at <i>Landen.</i>——Possibly
not,——<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby;</i>——though if they have the advantage of a
wood, or you give them a moment’s time to intrench themselves, they are a nation which will pop and pop for
ever at you.——There is no way but to march coolly up to
them,——receive their fire, and fall in upon them,
pell-mell——Ding dong, added
<i>Trim.</i>——Horse and foot, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——Helter Skelter, said
<i>Trim.</i>——Right and left, cried my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——Blood an’ ounds, shouted the
corporal;——the battle raged,——<i>Yorick</i>
drew his chair a little to one side for safety, and after a
moment’s pause, my uncle <i>Toby</i> sinking his voice a
note,—resumed the discourse as follows.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXII</small>
</h3>

<p>K<small>ING</small> <i>William</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to <i>Yorick</i>, was so terribly
provoked at count <i>Solmes</i> for disobeying his orders, that he
would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months
after.——I fear, answered <i>Yorick</i>, the squire will
be as much provoked at the corporal, as the King at the count.——But ’twould be
singularly hard in this case, continued be, if corporal
<i>Trim</i>, who has behaved so diametrically opposite to count
<i>Solmes</i>, should have the fate to be rewarded with the same
disgrace:——too oft in this world, do things take that
train.——I would spring a mine, cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, rising up,——and blow up my fortifications,
and my house with them, and we would perish under their ruins, ere
I would stand by and see it.——<i>Trim</i> directed a
slight,——but a grateful bow towards his
master,——and so the chapter ends.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——Then, <i>Yorick</i>, replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, you and I will lead the way abreast,——and
do you, corporal, follow a few paces behind us.——And
<i>Susannah</i>, an’ please your honour, said <i>Trim</i>,
shall be put in the rear.——’Twas an excellent
disposition,—and in this order, without either drums beating, or colours flying, they
marched slowly from my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s house to
<i>Shandy-hall.</i></p>

<p>——I wish, said <i>Trim</i>, as they entered the
door,—instead of the sash weights, I had cut off the church
spout, as I once thought to have done.—You have cut off
spouts enow, replied <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>As many pictures as have been given
of my father, how like him soever in different airs and
attitudes,—not one, or all of them, can ever help the reader
to any kind of preconception of how my father would think, speak,
or act, upon any untried occasion or occurrence of
life.—There was that infinitude of oddities in him, and of
chances along with it, by which handle he would take a
thing,—it baffled, Sir, all calculations.——The
truth was, his road lay so very far on one side, from that wherein
most men travelled,—that every object before him presented a
face and section of itself to his eye, altogether different from the plan and
elevation of it seen by the rest of mankind.—In other words,
’twas a different object, and in course was differently
considered:</p>

<p>This is the true reason, that my dear <i>Jenny</i> and I, as
well as all the world besides us, have such eternal squabbles about
nothing.—She looks at her outside,—I, at her in—.
How is it possible we should agree about her value?</p>

still held to be no digression.

<p>F<small>IFTY</small> thousand pannier loads of
devils—(not of the Archbishop of
<i>Benevento</i>’s—I mean of <i>Rabelais</i>’s
devils), with their tails chopped off by their rumps, could not
have made so diabolical a scream of it, as I did—when the
accident befel me: it summoned up my mother instantly into the
nursery,—so that <i>Susannah</i> had but just time to make
her escape down the back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.</p>

<p>Now, though I was old enough to have told the story
myself,—and young enough, I hope, to have done it without
malignity; yet <i>Susannah</i>, in passing by the kitchen, for fear
of accidents, had left it in short-hand with the cook—the
cook had told it with a commentary to <i>Jonathan</i>, and
<i>Jonathan</i> to <i>Obadiah;</i> so that by the time my father
had rung the bell half a dozen times, to know what was the matter
above,—was <i>Obadiah</i> enabled to give him a
particular account of it, just as it had happened.—I
thought as much, said my father, tucking up his
night-gown;—and so walked up stairs.</p>

<p>One would imagine from this——(though for my own part
I somewhat question it)—that my father, before that time, had
actually wrote that remarkable character in the
<i>Tristra-pædia</i>, which to me is the most original and
entertaining one in the whole book;—and that is the
<i>chapter upon sash-windows</i>, with a bitter <i>Philippick</i>
at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness of chamber-maids.—I
have but two reasons for thinking otherwise.</p>

<p>First, Had the matter been taken into consideration, before the
event happened, my father certainly would have nailed up the sash
window for good an’ all;—which, considering with what
difficulty he composed books,—he might have done with ten
times less trouble, than he could have wrote the chapter: this
argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter, even
after the event; but ’tis obviated under the second reason,
which I have the honour to offer to the world in support of my
opinion, that my father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows
and chamber-pots, at the time supposed,—and it is this.</p>

<p>——That, in order to render the
<i>Tristra-pædia</i> complete,—I wrote the chapter
myself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father put on his
spectacles—looked,—took them off,—put them into
the case—all in less than a statutable minute; and without
opening his lips, turned about and walked precipitately down
stairs: my mother imagined he had stepped down for lint and
basilicon; but seeing him return with a couple of folios under his
arm, and <i>Obadiah</i> following him with a large reading-desk,
she took it for granted ’twas an herbal, and so drew him a
chair to the bedside, that he might consult upon the case at his
ease.</p>

<p>——If it be but right done,—said my
father, turning to the <i>Section—de sede vel subjecto
circumcisionis</i>,—for he had brought up <i>Spenser de
Legibus Hebræorum Ritualibus</i>—and <i>Maimonides</i>,
in order to confront and examine us altogether.——</p>

<p>——If it be but right done, quoth he:—only tell
us, cried my mother, interrupting him, what herbs?——For
that, replied my father, you must send for Dr. <i>Slop.</i></p>

<p>My mother went down, and my father went on, reading the section
as follows,</p>

<p>* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*—Very
well,—said my father, &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*
&nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*—nay, if it has that
convenience——and so without stopping a moment to settle
it first in his mind, whether the <i>Jews</i> had it from the
<i>Egyptians</i>, or the <i>Egyptians</i> from the
<i>Jews</i>,—he rose up, and rubbing his forehead two or
three times across with the palm of his hand, in the
manner we rub out the footsteps of care, when evil has trod lighter
upon us than we foreboded,—he shut the book, and walked down
stairs.—Nay, said he, mentioning the name of a different
great nation upon every step as he set his foot upon it—if
the E<small>GYPTIANS</small>,—the
S<small>YRIANS</small>,—the
P<small>HOENICIANS</small>,—the
A<small>RABIANS</small>,—the
C<small>APPADOCIANS</small>,——if the
C<small>OLCHI</small>, and T<small>ROGLODYTES</small> did
it——if S<small>OLON</small> and
P<small>YTHAGORAS</small> submitted,—what is
T<small>RISTRAM</small>?——Who am I, that I should fret
or fume one moment about the matter?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>D<small>EAR</small> <i>Yorick</i>, said my father
smiling (for <i>Yorick</i> had broke his rank with my uncle
<i>Toby</i> in coming through the narrow entry, and so had stept
first into the parlour)—this <i>Tristram</i> of ours, I find,
comes very hardly by all his religious rites.—Never was the
son of <i>Jew, Christian, Turk</i>, or <i>Infidel</i> initiated
into them in so oblique and slovenly a manner.—But
he is no worse, I trust, said <i>Yorick.</i>—There has been
certainly, continued my father, the deuce and all to do in some
part or other of the ecliptic, when this offspring of mine was
formed.—That, you are a better judge of than I, replied
<i>Yorick.</i>—Astrologers, quoth my father, know better than
us both:—the trine and sextil aspects have jumped
awry,—or the opposite of their ascendents have not hit it, as
they should,—or the lords of the genitures (as they call
them) have been at <i>bo-peep</i>,—or something has been
wrong above, or below with us.</p>

<p>
’Tis possible, answered <i>Yorick.</i>—But is the child, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, the worse?—The <i>Troglodytes</i> say not, replied my
father. And your theologists, <i>Yorick</i>, tell us—Theologically? said
<i>Yorick</i>,—or speaking after the manner of apothecaries?<a href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>—statesmen?<a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>—or
washer-women?<a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>——I’m not sure, replied my father,—but
they tell us, brother <i>Toby</i>, he’s the better for
it.——Provided, said <i>Yorick</i>, you travel him into
<i>Egypt.</i>—Of that, answered my father, he will have the
advantage, when he sees the <i>Pyramids.</i>——</p>

<p>Now every word of this, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, is
<i>Arabic</i> to me.——I wish, said <i>Yorick</i>,
’twas so, to half the world.</p>

<p>
—I<small>LUS</small>,<a href="#linknote-28" name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> continued my father, circumcised his
whole army one morning.—Not without a court martial? cried my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——Though the learned, continued he, taking no notice of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s remark, but turning to <i>Yorick</i>,—are
greatly divided still who <i>Ilus</i> was;—some say
<i>Saturn;</i>—some the Supreme Being;—others, no more than a
brigadier general under <i>Pharaoh-neco.</i>——Let him be who he
will, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I know not by what article of war he could
justify it.
</p>

<p>The controvertists, answered my father, assign two-and-twenty
different reasons for it:—others, indeed, who have drawn
their pens on the opposite side of the question, have shewn the
world the futility of the greatest part of them.—But then
again, our best polemic divines—I wish there was not a
polemic divine, said <i>Yorick</i>, in the kingdom;—one ounce
of practical divinity—is worth a painted ship-load of all
their reverences have imported these fifty years.—Pray, Mr.
<i>Yorick</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—do tell me what a
polemic divine is?——The best description, captain
<i>Shandy</i>, I have ever read, is of a couple of ’em,
replied <i>Yorick</i>, in the account of the battle fought single
hands betwixt <i>Gymnast</i> and captain <i>Tripet;</i> which I
have in my pocket.——I beg I may hear it, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i> earnestly.—You shall, said <i>Yorick.</i>—And as the corporal
is waiting for me at the door,—and I know the description of
a battle will do the poor fellow more good than his supper,—I
beg, brother, you’ll give him leave to come in.—With
all my soul, said my father.——<i>Trim</i> came in,
erect and happy as an emperor; and having shut the door,
<i>Yorick</i> took a book from his right-hand coat-pocket, and
read, or pretended to read, as follows.</p>

<p>——“which words being heard
by all the soldiers which were there, divers of them being inwardly
terrified, did shrink back and make room for the assailant: all
this did <i>Gymnast</i> very well remark and consider; and
therefore, making as if he would have alighted from off his horse,
as he was poising himself on the mounting side, he most nimbly
(with his short sword by this thigh) shifting his feet in the stirrup, and performing the
stirrup-leather feat, whereby, after the inclining of his body
downwards, he forthwith launched himself aloft into the air, and
placed both his feet together upon the saddle, standing upright,
with his back turned towards his horse’s head,—Now,
(said he) my case goes forward. Then suddenly in the same posture
wherein he was, he fetched a gambol upon one foot, and turning to
the left-hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just
into his former position, without missing one jot.——Ha!
said <i>Tripet</i>, I will not do that at this time,—and not
without cause. Well, said <i>Gymnast</i>, I have failed,—I
will undo this leap; then with a marvellous strength and agility,
turning towards the right-hand, he fetched another striking gambol
as before; which done, he set his right hand thumb upon the bow of
the saddle, raised himself up, and sprung into the air, poising and
upholding his whole weight upon the muscle and nerve of the
said thumb, and so turned and whirled himself about three times: at
the fourth, reversing his body, and overturning it upside down, and
foreside back, without <i>touching any thing</i>, he brought
himself betwixt the horse’s two ears, and then giving himself
a jerking swing, he seated himself upon the
crupper—”</p>

<p>(This can’t be fighting, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——The corporal shook his head at
it.——Have patience, said <i>Yorick.</i>)</p>

<p>“Then (<i>Tripet</i>) pass’d his right
leg over his saddle, and placed himself <i>en croup.</i>—But,
said he, ’twere better for me to get into the saddle; then
putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and
there-upon leaning himself, as upon the only supporters of his
body, he incontinently turned heels over head in the air, and
strait found himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a tolerable
seat; then springing into the air with a summerset, he turned him
about like a wind-mill, and made above a hundred
frisks, turns, and demi-pommadas.”—Good God! cried
<i>Trim</i>, losing all patience,—one home thrust of a
bayonet is worth it all.——I think so too, replied
<i>Yorick.</i>——</p>

<p>I am of a contrary opinion, quoth my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXX</small>
</h3>

<p>——No,—I think I have advanced
nothing, replied my father, making answer to a question which
<i>Yorick</i> had taken the liberty to put to him,—I have
advanced nothing in the <i>Tristra-pædia</i>, but what is as
clear as any one proposition in <i>Euclid.</i>—Reach me,
<i>Trim</i>, that book from off the scrutoir:—it has
oft-times been in my mind, continued my father, to have read it
over both to you, <i>Yorick</i>, and to my brother <i>Toby</i>, and
I think it a little unfriendly in myself, in not having done it
long ago:——shall we have a short chapter or two
now,—and a chapter or two hereafter, as occasions serve; and so on, till we get through the
whole? My uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Yorick</i> made the obeisance
which was proper; and the corporal, though he was not included in
the compliment, laid his hand upon his breast, and made his bow at
the same time.——The company smiled. <i>Trim</i>, quoth
my father, has paid the full price for staying out the
<i>entertainment.</i>——He did not seem to relish the
play, replied <i>Yorick.</i>——’Twas a
Tom-fool-battle, an’ please your reverence, of captain
<i>Tripet</i>&nbsp;’s and that other officer, making so many
summersets, as they advanced;——the <i>French</i> come
on capering now and then in that way,—but not quite so
much.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> never felt the consciousness of his
existence with more complacency than what the corporal’s, and
his own reflections, made him do at that moment;——he
lighted his pipe,——<i>Yorick</i> drew his chair closer
to the table,—<i>Trim</i> snuff’d the candle,—my
father stirr’d up the fire,—took up the
book,—cough’d twice, and begun.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> first thirty pages, said my
father, turning over the leaves,—are a little dry; and as
they are not closely connected with the subject,——for
the present we’ll pass them by: ’tis a prefatory
introduction, continued my father, or an introductory preface (for
I am not determined which name to give it) upon political or civil
government; the foundation of which being laid in the first
conjunction betwixt male and female, for procreation of the
species——I was insensibly led into
it.——’Twas natural, said <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>The original of society, continued my father, I’m
satisfied is, what <i>Politian</i> tells us, <i>i.e.</i> merely
conjugal; and nothing more than the getting together of one man and
one woman;—to which, (according to <i>Hesiod</i>) the
philosopher adds a servant:—but supposing in the first
beginning there were no men servants born——he lays the
foundation of it, in a man,—a woman—and a
bull.——I believe ’tis an ox, quoth <i>Yorick</i>,
quoting the passage ([Greek text])——A bull must have
given more trouble than his head was worth.—But there is a
better reason still, said my father (dipping his pen into his ink);
for the ox being the most patient of animals, and the most useful
withal in tilling the ground for their nourishment,—was the
properest instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple,
that the creation could have associated with them.—And there
is a stronger reason, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, than them all for
the ox.—My father had not power to take his pen out of his
ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
reason.—For when the ground was tilled, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, and made worth inclosing, then they began to secure it
by walls and ditches, which was the origin of
fortification.——True, true, dear <i>Toby</i>, cried my
father, striking out the bull, and putting the ox in his place.</p>

<p>My father gave <i>Trim</i> a nod, to snuff the candle, and
resumed his discourse.</p>

<p>——I enter upon this speculation, said my father
carelessly, and half shutting the book, as he went on, merely to
shew the foundation of the natural relation between a father and
his child; the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these
several ways—</p>

<p>1st, by marriage.</p>

<p>2d, by adoption.</p>

<p>3d, by legitimation.</p>

<p>And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their
order.</p>

<p>I lay a slight stress upon one of them, replied
<i>Yorick</i>——the act, especially where it ends there,
in my opinion lays as little obligation upon the child, as it
conveys power to the father.—You are wrong,—said my
father argutely, and for this plain reason * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.—I own,
added my father, that the offspring, upon this account, is not so
under the power and jurisdiction of the mother.—But
the reason, replied <i>Yorick</i>, equally holds good for
her.—She is under authority herself, said my
father:—and besides, continued my father, nodding his head,
and laying his finger upon the side of his nose, as he assigned his
reason,—<i>she is not the principal agent</i>,
Yorick.—In what, quoth my uncle <i>Toby?</i> stopping his
pipe.—Though by all means, added my father (not attending to
my uncle <i>Toby</i>), “The son ought to pay her
respect,” as you may read, <i>Yorick</i>, at large in the
first book of the Institutes of <i>Justinian</i>, at the eleventh
title and the tenth section.—I can read it as well, replied
<i>Yorick</i>, in the Catechism.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>RIM</small> can repeat every word of it by
heart, quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Pugh! said my father, not
caring to be interrupted with <i>Trim</i>’s saying his
Catechism. He can, upon my honour, replied my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Ask him, Mr. <i>Yorick</i>,
any question you please.——</p>

<p>—The fifth Commandment, <i>Trim</i>,—said
<i>Yorick</i>, speaking mildly, and with a gentle nod, as to a
modest Catechumen. The corporal stood silent.—You don’t
ask him right, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, raising his voice, and
giving it rapidly like the word of command:——The
fifth———cried my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—I must
begin with the first, an’ please your honour, said the
corporal.——</p>

<p>—<i>Yorick</i> could not forbear smiling.—Your
reverence does not consider, said the corporal, shouldering his
stick like a musket, and marching into the middle of the room, to
illustrate his position,—that ’tis exactly the same
thing, as doing one’s exercise in the field.—</p>

<p>“<i>Join your right-hand to your firelock</i>,”
cried the corporal, giving the word of command, and performing the
motion.—</p>

<p>“<i>Poise your firelock</i>,” cried the corporal,
doing the duty still both of adjutant and private man.</p>

<p>“<i>Rest your firelock;</i>”—one motion,
an’ please your reverence, you see leads into
another.—If his honour will begin but with the
<i>first</i>—</p>

<p>T<small>HE FIRST</small>—cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
setting his hand upon his side—* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * *.</p>

<p>T<small>HE SECOND</small>—cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
waving his tobacco-pipe, as he would have done his sword at the
head of a regiment.—The corporal went through his
<i>manual</i> with exactness; and having <i>honoured his father and
mother</i>, made a low bow, and fell back to the side of the
room.</p>

<p>Every thing in this world, said my father, is big with jest, and
has wit in it, and instruction too,—if we can but find it
out.</p>

<p>—Here is the <i>scaffold work</i> of
I<small>NSTRUCTION</small>, its true point of folly, without the
<small>BUILDING</small> behind it.</p>

<p>—Here is the glass for pedagogues, preceptors, tutors,
governors, gerund-grinders, and bear-leaders to view themselves in,
in their true dimensions.—</p>

<p>Oh! there is a husk and shell, <i>Yorick</i>, which grows up
with learning, which their unskilfulness knows not how to fling
away!</p>

<p>—S<small>CIENCES MAY BE LEARNED BY ROTE BUT WISDOM
NOT.</small></p>

<p>
<i>Yorick</i> thought my father inspired.—I will enter into obligations
this moment, said my father, to lay out all my aunt <i>Dinah</i>’s legacy
in charitable uses (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion), if
the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word he has
repeated.—Prithee, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my father, turning round to
him,—What dost thou mean, by “<i>honouring thy father and
mother?</i>”
</p>

<p>Allowing them, an’ please your honour, three halfpence a
day out of my pay, when they grow old.—And didst thou do
that, <i>Trim</i>? said <i>Yorick.</i>—He did indeed, replied
my uncle <i>Toby.</i>—Then, <i>Trim</i>, said <i>Yorick</i>,
springing out of his chair, and taking the corporal by the hand,
thou art the best commentator upon that part of the
<i>Decalogue;</i> and I honour thee more for it, corporal <i>Trim</i>, than
if thou hadst had a hand in the <i>Talmud</i> itself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIIIV</small>
</h3>

<p>O <small>BLESSED</small> health! cried my father,
making an exclamation, as he turned over the leaves to the next
chapter, thou art before all gold and treasure; ’tis thou who
enlargest the soul,—and openest all its powers to receive
instruction and to relish virtue.—He that has thee, has
little more to wish for;—and he that is so wretched as to
want thee,—wants every thing with thee.</p>

<p>I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important
head, said my father, into a very little room, therefore
we’ll read the chapter quite through.</p>

<p>My father read as follows:</p>

<p>
“The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery
betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture”—You have proved
that matter of fact, I suppose, above, said <i>Yorick.</i> Sufficiently,
replied my father.
</p>

<p>In saying this, my father shut the book,—not as if he
resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his fore-finger in the
chapter:——nor pettishly,—for he shut the book
slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side
of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it,
without the least compressive violence.——</p>

<p>I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father,
nodding to <i>Yorick</i>, most sufficiently in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth
had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of
all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the
<i>radical heat</i> and the <i>radical moisture</i>,—and that
he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single
word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout
the whole chapter,—or a single syllable in it, <i>pro</i> or
<i>con</i>, directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt
these two powers in any part of the animal
œconomy——</p>

<p>“O thou eternal Maker of all
beings!”—he would cry, striking his breast with
his right hand (in case he had one)—“Thou whose
power and goodness can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to
this infinite degree of excellence and perfection,—What have
we M<small>OONITES</small> done?”</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>ITH</small> two strokes, the one at
<i>Hippocrates</i>, the other at Lord <i>Verulam</i>, did my father
achieve it.</p>

<p>The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was
no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the
<i>Ars longa</i>,—and <i>Vita brevis.</i>——Life
short, cried my father,—and the art of healing tedious! And
who are we to thank for both the one and the other, but the
ignorance of quacks themselves,—and the stage-loads of
chymical nostrums, and peripatetic lumber, with which, in all
ages, they have first flatter’d the world, and at last
deceived it?</p>

<p>——O my lord <i>Verulam!</i> cried my father,
turning from <i>Hippocrates</i>, and making his second stroke at
him, as the principal of nostrum-mongers, and the fittest to be
made an example of to the rest,—What shall I say to thee, my
great lord <i>Verulam?</i> What shall I say to thy internal
spirit,—thy opium, thy salt-petre,——thy greasy
unctions,—thy daily purges,—thy nightly clysters, and
succedaneums?</p>

<p>——My father was never at a loss what to say to any
man, upon any subject; and had the least occasion for the exordium
of any man breathing: how he dealt with his lordship’s
opinion,——you shall see;——but when—I
know not:——we must first see what his lordship’s
opinion was.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXV</small>
</h3>

<p>“T<small>HE</small> two great causes,
which conspire with each other to shorten life, says lord
<i>Verulam</i>, are first——</p>

<p>“The internal spirit, which like a gentle flame
wastes the body down to death:—And secondly, the external
air, that parches the body up to ashes:—which two enemies
attacking us on both sides of our bodies together, at length
destroy our organs, and render them unfit to carry on the functions
of life.”</p>

<p>This being the state of the case, the road to longevity was
plain; nothing more being required, says his lordship, but to
repair the waste committed by the internal spirit, by making the
substance of it more thick and dense, by a regular course of
opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat of it on the
other, by three grains and a half of salt-petre every morning
before you got up.——</p>

<p>Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical
assaults of the air without;—but this was fenced off again by
a course of greasy unctions, which so fully saturated the pores of
the skin, that no spicula could enter;——nor could any
one get out.——This put a stop to all perspiration,
sensible and insensible, which being the cause of so many scurvy
distempers—a course of clysters was requisite to carry off
redundant humours,—and render the system complete.</p>

<p>What my father had to say to my lord of <i>Verulam</i>’s
opiates, his salt-petre, and greasy unctions and clysters, you
shall read,—but not to-day—or to-morrow: time presses
upon me,—my reader is impatient—I must get
forwards——You shall read the chapter at your leisure
(if you chuse it), as soon as ever the <i>Tristra-pædia</i>
is published.——</p>

<p>Sufficeth it, at present to say, my father levelled the
hypothesis with the ground, and in doing that, the learned know, he
built up and established his own.——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> whole secret of health, said my
father, beginning the sentence again, depending evidently upon the
due contention betwixt the radical heat and radical moisture within
us;—the least imaginable skill had been sufficient to have
maintained it, had not the school-men confounded the task, merely
(as <i>Van Helmont</i>, the famous chymist, has proved) by all
along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of
animal bodies.</p>

<p>Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals,
but an oily and balsamous substance; for the fat and tallow, as
also the phlegm or watery parts, are cold; whereas the oily and
balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit, which accounts for
the observation of <i>Aristotle</i>, “<i>Quod omne
animal post coitum est</i> triste.”</p>

<p>Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical
moisture, but whether <i>vice versa</i>, is a doubt: however, when the one
decays, the other decays also; and then is produced, either an
unnatural heat, which causes an unnatural dryness——or
an unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.——So that
if a child, as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into
fire or water, as either of ’em threaten his
destruction,——’twill be all that is needful to be
done upon that head.——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> description of the siege of
<i>Jericho</i> itself, could not have engaged the attention of my
uncle <i>Toby</i> more powerfully than the last chapter;—his
eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it;—he never
mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle
<i>Toby</i> took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and
as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the corporal to
come close to his chair, to ask him the following question,—<i>aside.</i>— * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * *. It was at the siege of <i>Limerick</i>,
an’ please your honour, replied the corporal, making a
bow.</p>

<p>The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing
himself to my father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents,
at the time the siege of <i>Limerick</i> was raised, upon the very
account you mention.——Now what can have got into that
precious noddle of thine, my dear brother <i>Toby?</i> cried
my father, mentally.——By Heaven! continued he,
communing still with himself, it would puzzle an
<i>Œdipus</i> to bring it in point.——</p>

<p>I believe, an’ please your honour, quoth the corporal,
that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to
every night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your
honour off;—And the geneva, <i>Trim</i>, added my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, which did us more good than all——I verily
believe, continued the corporal, we had both, an’ please your honour, left our lives in the trenches, and
been buried in them too.——The noblest grave, corporal!
cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that a
soldier could wish to lie down in.——But a pitiful death
for him! an’ please your honour, replied the corporal.</p>

<p>All this was as much <i>Arabick</i> to my father, as the rites
of the <i>Colchi</i> and <i>Troglodites</i> had been before to my
uncle <i>Toby;</i> my father could not determine whether he was to
frown or to smile.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, turning to <i>Yorick</i>, resumed the case
at <i>Limerick</i>, more intelligibly than he had begun
it,—and so settled the point for my father at once.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was undoubtedly, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, a great happiness for myself and the corporal, that we
had all along a burning fever, attended with a most raging thirst,
during the whole five-and-twenty days the flux was upon us in the
camp; otherwise what my brother calls the radical moisture, must, as I conceive it,
inevitably have got the better.——My father drew in his
lungs top-full of air, and looking up, blew it forth again, as
slowly as he possibly could.——</p>

<p>——It was Heaven’s mercy to us, continued my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, which put it into the corporal’s head to
maintain that due contention betwixt the radical heat and the
radical moisture, by reinforceing the fever, as he did all along,
with hot wine and spices; whereby the corporal kept up (as it were)
a continual firing, so that the radical heat stood its ground from
the beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the moisture,
terrible as it was.——Upon my honour, added my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, you might have heard the contention within our bodies,
brother <i>Shandy</i>, twenty toises.—If there was no firing,
said <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>
Well—said my father, with a full aspiration, and pausing a while after
the word——Was I a judge, and the laws of the country which made me
one permitted it, I would condemn some of the worst malefactors, provided they
had had their
clergy—————————————<i>Yorick</i>,
foreseeing the sentence was likely to end with no sort of mercy, laid his hand
upon my father’s breast, and begged he would respite it for a few
minutes, till he asked the corporal a question.——Prithee,
<i>Trim</i>, said <i>Yorick</i>, without staying for my father’s
leave,—tell us honestly—what is thy opinion concerning this
self-same radical heat and radical moisture?
</p>

<p>With humble submission to his honour’s better judgment,
quoth the corporal, making a bow to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—Speak thy opinion freely, corporal, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>—The poor fellow is my servant,—not my
slave,—added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, turning to my
father.——</p>

<p>The corporal put his hat under his left arm, and with his stick
hanging upon the wrist of it, by a black thong split into a tassel
about the knot, he marched up to the ground where he had performed his catechism; then touching his
under-jaw with the thumb and fingers of his right hand before he
opened his mouth,——he delivered his notion thus.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>J<small>UST</small> as the corporal was humming, to
begin—in waddled Dr. <i>Slop.</i>—’Tis not
two-pence matter—the corporal shall go on in the next
chapter, let who will come in.——</p>

<p>Well, my good doctor, cried my father sportively, for the
transitions of his passions were unaccountably sudden,—and
what has this whelp of mine to say to the matter?</p>

<p>Had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a
puppy-dog—he could not have done it in a more careless air:
the system which Dr. <i>Slop</i> had laid down, to treat the
accident by, no way allowed of such a mode of enquiry.—He sat
down.</p>

<p>Pray, Sir, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in a manner which could
not go unanswered,—in what condition is the
boy?—’Twill end in a <i>phimosis</i>, replied Dr.
<i>Slop.</i></p>

<p>I am no wiser than I was, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—returning his pipe into his
mouth.——Then let the corporal go on, said my father,
with his medical lecture.—The corporal made a bow to his old
friend, Dr. <i>Slop</i>, and then delivered his opinion concerning
radical heat and radical moisture, in the following words.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XL</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> city of <i>Limerick</i>, the
siege of which was begun under his majesty king <i>William</i>
himself, the year after I went into the army—lies, an’
please your honours, in the middle of a devilish wet, swampy
country.—’Tis quite surrounded, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, with the <i>Shannon</i>, and is, by its situation, one
of the strongest fortified places in
<i>Ireland.</i>——</p>

<p>I think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr. <i>Slop</i>, of
beginning a medical lecture.—’Tis all true, answered
<i>Trim.</i>—Then I wish the faculty would follow the cut of
it, said <i>Yorick.</i>—’Tis all cut through, an’
please your reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and
besides, there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege,
the whole country was like a puddle,—’twas that, and
nothing else, which brought on the flux, and which had like to have
killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such thing,
after the first ten days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to
lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off
the water;—nor was that enough, for those who could afford
it, as his honour could, without setting fire every night to a
pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and
made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.——</p>

<p>And what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal <i>Trim</i>, cried
my father, from all these premises?</p>

<p>I infer, an’ please your worship, replied <i>Trim</i>,
that the radical moisture is nothing in the world but
ditch-water—and that the radical heat, of those who can go to
the expence of it, is burnt brandy,—the radical heat and
moisture of a private man, an’ please your honour, is nothing
but ditch-water—and a dram of geneva——and give us
but enough of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and
drive away the vapours—we know not what it is to fear
death.</p>

<p>I am at a loss, Captain <i>Shandy</i>, quoth Doctor <i>Slop</i>,
to determine in which branch of learning your servant shines most,
whether in physiology or divinity.—<i>Slop</i> had not forgot
<i>Trim</i>’s comment upon the sermon.—</p>

<p>It is but an hour ago, replied <i>Yorick</i>, since the corporal
was examined in the latter, and passed muster with great
honour.——</p>

<p>The radical heat and moisture, quoth Doctor <i>Slop</i>, turning
to my father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our
being—as the root of a tree is the source and principle of its vegetation.—It
is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be preserved
sundry ways, but principally in my opinion by <i>consubstantials,
impriments</i>, and <i>occludents.</i>——Now this poor
fellow, continued Dr. <i>Slop</i>, pointing to the corporal, has
had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse
upon this nice point.——That he has,—said my
father.——Very likely, said my uncle.—I’m
sure of it—quoth <i>Yorick.</i>——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLI</small>
</h3>

<p>D<small>OCTOR</small> <i>Slop</i> being called out
to look at a cataplasm he had ordered, it gave my father an
opportunity of going on with another chapter in the
<i>Tristra-pædia.</i>——Come! cheer up, my lads;
I’ll shew you land——for when we have tugged
through that chapter, the book shall not be opened again this
twelve-month.—Huzza!—</p>

<h3>

<p>——F<small>IVE</small> years with a bib
under his chin;</p>

<p>Four years in travelling from Christ-cross-row to
<i>Malachi;</i></p>

<p>A year and a half in learning to write his own name;</p>

<p>Seven long years and more τυπιω-ing
it, at Greek and Latin;</p>

<p>Four years at his <i>probations</i> and his
<i>negations</i>—the fine statue still lying in the middle of
the marble block,—and nothing done, but his tools sharpened
to hew it out!—’Tis a piteous delay!—Was not the
great <i>Julius Scaliger</i> within an ace of never getting his
tools sharpened at all?——Forty-four years old was he
before he could manage his Greek;—and <i>Peter Damianus</i>,
lord bishop of <i>Ostia</i>, as all the world knows, could not so
much as read, when he was of man’s estate.—And
<i>Baldus</i> himself, as eminent as he turned out after, entered
upon the law so late in life, that every body imagined he intended to be an advocate in
the other world: no wonder, when <i>Eudamidas</i>, the son of
<i>Archidamas</i>, heard <i>Xenocrates</i> at seventy-five
disputing about <i>wisdom</i>, that he asked gravely,—<i>If
the old man be yet disputing and enquiring concerning
wisdom,—what time will he have to make use of it?</i></p>

<p><i>Yorick</i> listened to my father with great attention; there
was a seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest
whims, and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of
his eclipses, as almost atoned for them:—be wary, Sir, when
you imitate him.</p>

<p>I am convinced, <i>Yorick</i>, continued my father, half reading
and half discoursing, that there is a North-west passage to the
intellectual world; and that the soul of man has shorter ways of
going to work, in furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction,
than we generally take with it.——But, alack! all fields
have not a river or a spring running besides them;—every
child, <i>Yorick</i>, has not a parent to point it out.</p>

<p>——The whole entirely depends, added my father, in a
low voice, upon the <i>auxiliary verbs</i>, Mr. <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>Had <i>Yorick</i> trod upon <i>Virgil</i>&nbsp;’s snake,
he could not have looked more surprised.—I am surprised too,
cried my father, observing it,—and I reckon it as one of the
greatest calamities which ever befel the republic of letters, That
those who have been entrusted with the education of our children,
and whose business it was to open their minds, and stock them early
with ideas, in order to set the imagination loose upon them, have
made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it, as they have
done——So that, except <i>Raymond Lullius</i>, and the
elder <i>Pelegrini</i>, the last of which arrived to such
perfection in the use of ’em, with his topics, that, in a few
lessons, he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with
plausibility upon any subject, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, and to
say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it,
without blotting a word, to the admiration of all who beheld
him.—I should be glad, said <i>Yorick</i>, interrupting my father,
to be made to comprehend this matter. You shall, said my
father.</p>

<p>The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of,
is a high metaphor,——for which, in my opinion, the idea
is generally the worse, and not the better;——but be
that as it may,—when the mind has done that with
it—there is an end,—the mind and the idea are at
rest,—until a second idea enters;—and so on.</p>

<p>Now the use of the <i>Auxiliaries</i> is, at once to set the
soul a-going by herself upon the materials as they are brought her;
and by the versability of this great engine, round which they are
twisted, to open new tracts of enquiry, and make every idea
engender millions.</p>

<p>You excite my curiosity greatly, said <i>Yorick.</i></p>

<p>For my own part, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I have given it
up.——The <i>Danes</i>, an’ please your honour,
quoth the corporal, who were on the left at the siege of <i>Limerick</i>, were all
auxiliaries.——And very good ones, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>—But the auxiliaries, <i>Trim</i>, my brother is
talking about,—I conceive to be different
things.——</p>

<p>——You do? said my father, rising up.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father took a single turn across
the room, then sat down, and finished the chapter.</p>

<p>The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, continued my
father, are, <i>am; was; have; had; do; did; make; made; suffer;
shall; should; will; would; can; could; owe; ought; used;</i> or
<i>is wont.</i>—And these varied with tenses, <i>present,
past, future</i>, and <i>conjugated</i> with the verb
<i>see</i>,—or with these questions added to
them;—<i>Is it? Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May it be?
Might it be?</i> And these again put negatively, <i>Is it not? Was
it not? Ought it not?</i>—Or affirmatively,—<i>It
is; It was; It ought to be.</i> Or
chronologically,—<i>Has it been always? Lately? How long
ago?</i>—Or hypothetically,—<i>If it was? If it was
not?</i> What would follow?—If the <i>French</i> should beat
the <i>English?</i> If the <i>Sun</i> go out of the
<i>Zodiac?</i></p>

<p>Now, by the right use and application of these, continued my
father, in which a child’s memory should be exercised, there
is no one idea can enter his brain, how barren soever, but a
magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from
it.——Didst thou ever see a white bear? cried my father,
turning his head round to <i>Trim</i>, who stood at the back of his
chair:—No, an’ please your honour, replied the
corporal.——But thou couldst discourse about one,
<i>Trim</i>, said my father, in case of need?——How is
it possible, brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, if the corporal
never saw one?——’Tis the fact I want, replied my
father,—and the possibility of it is as follows.</p>

<p>A <small>WHITE BEAR</small>! Very well. Have I ever seen
one? Might I ever have seen one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever
to have seen one? Or can I ever see one?</p>

<p>Would I had seen a white bear! (for how can I imagine it?)</p>

<p>If I should see a white bear, what should I say? If I should
never see a white bear, what then?</p>

<p>If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive;
have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one
painted?—described? Have I never dreamed of one?</p>

<p>Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever
see a white bear? What would they give? How would they behave? How
would the white bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible?
Rough? Smooth?</p>

<p>—Is the white bear worth seeing?—</p>

<p>—Is there no sin in it?—</p>

<p>Is it better than a <small>BLACK ONE</small>?</p>

Sir,—only, as we have got through these five volumes<a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>, (do, Sir, sit down upon a
set——they are better than nothing) let us just look back upon the
country we have pass’d through.——

<p>——What a wilderness has it been! and what a mercy
that we have not both of us been lost, or devoured by wild beasts
in it!</p>

<p>Did you think the world itself, Sir, had contained such a number
of Jack Asses?——How they view’d and
review’d us as we passed over the rivulet at the bottom of
that little valley!——and when we climbed over that
hill, and were just getting out of sight—good God! what a
braying did they all set up together!</p>

<p>——Prithee, shepherd! who keeps all those
Jack Asses? * * *</p>

<p>——Heaven be their comforter——What! are
they never curried?——Are they never taken in in
winter?——Bray bray—bray. Bray on,—the world
is deeply your debtor;——louder still—that’s
nothing:—in good sooth, you are ill-used:——Was I
a Jack Asse, I solemnly declare, I would bray in G-sol-re-ut from
morning, even unto night.</p>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> my father had danced his white
bear backwards and forwards through half a dozen pages, he closed
the book for good an’ all,—and in a kind of triumph
redelivered it into <i>Trim</i>’s hand, with a nod to lay it
upon the ’scrutoire, where he found
it.——<i>Tristram</i>, said he, shall be made to
conjugate every word in the dictionary, backwards and forwards the
same way;——every word, <i>Yorick</i>, by this means,
you see, is converted into a thesis or an hypothesis;—every thesis and hypothesis have an off-spring of
propositions;—and each proposition has its own consequences
and conclusions; every one of which leads the mind on again, into
fresh tracks of enquiries and doubtings.——The force of
this engine, added my father, is incredible in opening a
child’s head.——’Tis enough, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to burst it into a
thousand splinters.——</p>

<p>
I presume, said <i>Yorick</i>, smiling,—it must be owing to
this,—(for let logicians say what they will, it is not to be accounted
for sufficiently from the bare use of the ten predicaments)——That
the famous <i>Vincent Quirino</i>, amongst the many other astonishing feats of
his childhood, of which the Cardinal <i>Bembo</i> has given the world so exact
a story,—should be able to paste up in the public schools at <i>Rome</i>,
so early as in the eighth year of his age, no less than four thousand five
hundred and fifty different theses, upon the most abstruse points of the most
abstruse theology;—and to defend and maintain them in such sort, as to
cramp and dumbfound his opponents.——What is that, cried my father,
to what is told us of <i>Alphonsus Tostatus</i>, who, almost in his
nurse’s arms, learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being
taught any one of them?——What shall we say of the great
<i>Piereskius?</i>—That’s the very man, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
I once told you of, brother <i>Shandy</i>, who walked a matter of five hundred
miles, reckoning from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Shevling</i>, and from <i>Shevling</i>
back again, merely to see <i>Stevinus</i>’s flying
chariot.——He was a very great man! added my uncle <i>Toby</i>
(meaning <i>Stevinus</i>)—He was so, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father
(meaning <i>Piereskius</i>)——and had multiplied his ideas so fast,
and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious stock, that, if we may give
credit to an anecdote concerning him, which we cannot withhold here, without
shaking the authority of all anecdotes whatever—at seven years of age,
his father committed entirely to his care the education of his younger brother,
a boy of five years old,—with the sole management of all his
concerns.—Was the father as wise as the son? quoth my uncle
<i>Toby:</i>—I should think not, said <i>Yorick:</i>—But what are
these, continued my father—(breaking out in a kind of
enthusiasm)—what are these, to those prodigies of childhood in
<i>Grotius, Scioppius, Heinsius, Politian, Pascal, Joseph Scaliger, Ferdinand
de Cordouè</i>, and others—some of which left off their <i>substantial
forms</i> at nine years old, or sooner, and went on reasoning without
them;—others went through their classics at seven;—wrote tragedies
at eight;—<i>Ferdinand de Cordouè</i> was so wise at
nine,—’twas thought the Devil was in him;—and at
<i>Venice</i> gave such proofs of his knowledge and goodness, that the monks
imagined he was <i>Antichrist</i>, or nothing.——Others were masters
of fourteen languages at ten,—finished the course of their rhetoric,
poetry, logic, and ethics, at eleven,—put forth their commentaries upon
<i>Servius</i> and <i>Martianus Capella</i> at twelve,—and at thirteen
received their degrees in philosophy, laws, and divinity:——but you
forget the great <i>Lipsius</i>, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, who composed a work<a href="#linknote-30" name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> the day he was born:——They
should have wiped it up, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and said no more about it.

<p>W<small>HEN</small> the cataplasm was ready, a
scruple of <i>decorum</i> had unseasonably rose up in
<i>Susannah</i>’s conscience, about holding the candle,
whilst <i>Slop</i> tied it on; <i>Slop</i> had not treated
<i>Susannah</i>’s distemper with anodynes,—and so a
quarrel had ensued betwixt them.</p>

<p>——Oh! oh!——said <i>Slop</i>,
casting a glance of undue freedom in <i>Susannah</i>’s face,
as she declined the office;——then, I think I know you,
madam——You know me, Sir! cried <i>Susannah</i>
fastidiously, and with a toss of her head, levelled evidently, not
at his profession, but at the doctor himself,——you know
me! cried <i>Susannah</i> again.——Doctor <i>Slop</i>
clapped his finger and his thumb instantly upon his
nostrils;——<i>Susannah</i>’s spleen was ready to
burst at it;——’Tis false, said
<i>Susannah.</i>—Come, come, Mrs. Modesty, said <i>Slop</i>,
not a little elated with the success of his last
thrust,——If you won’t hold the candle, and
look—you may hold it and shut your eyes:—That’s
one of your popish shifts, cried <i>Susannah:</i>—’Tis
better, said <i>Slop</i>, with a nod, than no shift at all, young
woman;——I defy you, Sir, cried <i>Susannah</i>, pulling
her shift sleeve below her elbow.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in
a surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality.</p>

<p>
<i>Slop</i> snatched up the cataplasm——<i>Susannah</i> snatched up
the candle;——A little this way, said <i>Slop;</i> <i>Susannah</i>
looking one way, and rowing another, instantly set fire to <i>Slop</i>’s
wig, which being somewhat bushy and unctuous withal, was burnt out before it
was well kindled.——You impudent whore! cried
<i>Slop</i>,—(for what is passion, but a wild beast?)—you impudent
whore, cried <i>Slop</i>, getting upright, with the cataplasm in his
hand;——I never was the destruction of any body’s nose, said
<i>Susannah</i>,—which is more than you can say:——Is it?
cried <i>Slop</i>, throwing the cataplasm in her face;——Yes, it is,
cried <i>Susannah</i>, returning the compliment with what was left in the pan.

<p>D<small>OCTOR</small> <i>Slop</i> and
<i>Susannah</i> filed cross-bills against each other in the
parlour; which done, as the cataplasm had failed, they retired into
the kitchen to prepare a fomentation for me;—and whilst that was doing, my father determined the
point as you will read.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>Y<small>OU</small> see ’tis high time, said my
father, addressing himself equally to my uncle <i>Toby</i> and
<i>Yorick</i>, to take this young creature out of these
women’s hands, and put him into those of a private governor.
<i>Marcus Antoninus</i> provided fourteen governors all at once to
superintend his son <i>Commodus</i>’s education,—and in
six weeks he cashiered five of them;—I know very well,
continued my father, that <i>Commodus</i>’s mother was in
love with a gladiator at the time of her conception, which accounts
for a great many of <i>Commodus</i>’s cruelties when he
became emperor;—but still I am of opinion, that those five
whom <i>Antoninus</i> dismissed, did <i>Commodus</i>’s
temper, in that short time, more hurt than the other nine were able
to rectify all their lives long.</p>

<p>Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the
mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night,
by which he is to adjust his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the
inmost sentiments of his heart;—I would have one,
<i>Yorick</i>, if possible, polished at all points, fit for my
child to look into.——This is very good sense, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i> to himself.</p>

<p>——There is, continued my father, a certain mien and
motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and speaking,
which argues a man <i>well within;</i> and I am not at all
surprised that <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Nazianzum</i>, upon observing
the hasty and untoward gestures of <i>Julian</i>, should foretel he
would one day become an apostate;——or that St.
<i>Ambrose</i> should turn his <i>Amanuensis</i> out of doors,
because of an indecent motion of his head, which went backwards and
forwards like a flail;——or that <i>Democritus</i>
should conceive <i>Protagoras</i> to be a scholar, from seeing him
bind up a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it, the small twigs
inwards.——There are a thousand unnoticed openings,
continued my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into
a man’s soul; and I maintain it, added he, that a man of
sense does not lay down his hat in coming into a room,—or
take it up in going out of it, but something escapes, which
discovers him.</p>

<p>
It is for these reasons, continued my father, that the governor I make choice
of shall neither<a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31" id="linknoteref-31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> lisp, or squint, or wink, or talk loud,
or look fierce, or foolish;——or bite his lips, or grind his teeth,
or speak through his nose, or pick it, or blow it with his
fingers.——
</p>

<p>He shall neither walk fast,—or slow, or fold his
arms,—for that is laziness;—or hang them
down,—for that is folly; or hide them in his pocket, for that
is nonsense.——</p>

<p>He shall neither strike, or pinch, or tickle—or bite, or
cut his nails, or hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his feet or
fingers in company;——nor (according to <i>Erasmus</i>)
shall he speak to any one in making water,—nor shall he point to
carrion or excrement.——Now this is all nonsense again,
quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> to himself.——</p>

<p>I will have him, continued my father, cheerful, faceté,
jovial; at the same time, prudent, attentive to business, vigilant,
acute, argute, inventive, quick in resolving doubts and speculative
questions;——he shall be wise, and judicious, and
learned:——And why not humble, and moderate, and
gentle-tempered, and good? said <i>Yorick:</i>——And why
not, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, free, and generous, and bountiful,
and brave?——He shall, my dear <i>Toby</i>, replied my
father, getting up and shaking him by his hand.—Then, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, raising himself off
the chair, and laying down his pipe to take hold of my
father’s other hand,—I humbly beg I may recommend poor
<i>Le Fever</i>’s son to you;——a tear of joy of
the first water sparkled in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s eye, and
another, the fellow to it, in the corporal’s, as the
proposition was made;——you will see why when you read <i>Le
Fever</i>’s story:——fool that I was! nor can I
recollect (nor perhaps you) without turning back to the place, what
it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in his
own words;—but the occasion is lost,—I must tell it now
in my own.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIX</small><br>
<br>
THE STORY OF LE FEVER
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was some time in the summer of
that year in which <i>Dendermond</i> was taken by the
allies,—which was about seven years before my father came
into the country,—and about as many, after the time, that my
uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> had privately decamped from my
father’s house in town, in order to lay some of the finest
sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in
<i>Europe</i>——when my uncle <i>Toby</i> was one
evening getting his supper, with <i>Trim</i> sitting behind him at
a small sideboard,—I say, sitting—for in consideration of the corporal’s lame knee
(which sometimes gave him exquisite pain)—when my uncle
<i>Toby</i> dined or supped alone, he would never suffer the
corporal to stand; and the poor fellow’s veneration for his
master was such, that, with a proper artillery, my uncle
<i>Toby</i> could have taken <i>Dendermond</i> itself, with less
trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a
time when my uncle <i>Toby</i> supposed the corporal’s leg
was at rest, he would look back, and detect him standing behind him
with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little squabbles
betwixt them, than all other causes for five-and-twenty years
together—But this is neither here nor there—why do I
mention it?——Ask my pen,—it governs me,—I
govern not it.</p>

<p>He was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord
of a little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty
phial in his hand, to beg a glass or two of sack; ’Tis for a
poor gentleman,—I think, of the army, said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house
four days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a
desire to taste any thing, till just now, that he has a fancy for a
glass of sack and a thin toast,——<i>I think</i>, says
he, taking his hand from his forehead, <i>it would comfort
me.</i>——</p>

<p>——If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a
thing—added the landlord,—I would almost steal it for
the poor gentleman, he is so ill.——I hope in God he
will still mend, continued he,—we are all of us concerned for
him.</p>

<p>Thou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my
uncle <i>Toby;</i> and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman’s
health in a glass of sack thyself,—and take a couple of
bottles with my service, and tell him he is heartily welcome to
them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.</p>

<p>Though I am persuaded, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as the
landlord shut the door, he is a very compassionate
fellow—<i>Trim</i>,—yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion
of his guest too; there must be something more than common in him,
that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of
his host;——And of his whole family, added the corporal,
for they are all concerned for him.——Step after him,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—do <i>Trim</i>,—and ask if
he knows his name.</p>

<p>——I have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord,
coming back into the parlour with the corporal,—but I can ask
his son again:——Has he a son with him then? said my
uncle <i>Toby.</i>—A boy, replied the landlord, of about
eleven or twelve years of age;—but the poor creature has
tasted almost as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn
and lament for him night and day:——He has not stirred
from the bed-side these two days.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> laid down his knife and fork, and thrust
his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account;
and <i>Trim</i>, without being ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a
few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</p>

<p>——Stay in the room a little, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p><i>Trim!</i>——said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, after
he lighted his pipe, and smoak’d about a dozen
whiffs.——<i>Trim</i> came in front of his master, and
made his bow;—my uncle <i>Toby</i> smoak’d on, and said
no more.——Corporal! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>—the
corporal made his bow.——My uncle <i>Toby</i> proceeded
no farther, but finished his pipe.</p>

<p><i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I have a project
in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my
roquelaure, and paying a visit to this poor
gentleman.——Your honour’s roquelaure, replied the
corporal, has not once been had on, since the night before your
honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches
before the gate of St. <i>Nicholas;</i>—and besides, it is so
cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the
weather, ’twill be enough to give your honour your death, and
bring on your honour’s torment in your groin. I fear so,
replied my uncle <i>Toby;</i> but I am not at rest in my mind,
<i>Trim</i>, since the account the landlord has given
me.——I wish I had not known so much of this
affair,—added my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—or that I had known
more of it:——How shall we manage it? Leave it,
an’t please your honour, to me, quoth the
corporal;——I’ll take my hat and stick and go to
the house and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring
your honour a full account in an hour.——Thou shalt go,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and here’s a shilling
for thee to drink with his servant.——I shall get it all
out of him, said the corporal, shutting the door.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> filled his second pipe; and had it not
been, that he now and then wandered from the point, with
considering whether it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight
line, as a crooked one,—he might be said to have thought of
nothing else but poor <i>Le Fever</i> and his boy the whole time he
smoaked it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp; &nbsp;L</small><br>
<br>
THE STORY OF LE FEVER CONTINUED
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was not till my uncle <i>Toby</i>
had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe, that corporal
<i>Trim</i> returned from the inn, and gave him the following
account.</p>

<p>I despaired, at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick
lieutenant—Is he in the army, then? said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——He is, said the corporal——And
in what regiment? said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——I’ll
tell your honour, replied the corporal, every thing straight
forwards, as I learnt it.—Then, <i>Trim</i>, I’ll fill
another pipe, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and not interrupt thee till thou hast done; so sit down at thy ease,
<i>Trim</i>, in the window-seat, and begin thy story again. The
corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow
could speak it—<i>Your honour is good:</i>—And having
done that, he sat down, as he was ordered,—and begun the
story to my uncle <i>Toby</i> over again in pretty near the same
words.</p>

<p>I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back any intelligence to your honour, about the lieutenant and his
son; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I made
myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be
asked,—That’s a right distinction, <i>Trim</i>, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>—I was answered, an’ please your
honour, that he had no servant with him;——that he had
come to the inn with hired horses, which, upon finding himself
unable to proceed (to join, I suppose, the regiment), he had
dismissed the morning after he came.—If I get better, my
dear, said he, as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man,—we
can hire horses from hence.——But alas! the poor
gentleman will never get from hence, said the landlady to
me,—for I heard the death-watch all night
long;——and when he dies, the youth, his son, will
certainly die with him; for he is broken- hearted already.</p>

<p>I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the
youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord
spoke of;——but I will do it for my father myself, said
the youth.——Pray let my save you the trouble, young
gentleman, said I, taking up a fork for the purpose, and offering
him my chair to sit down upon by the fire, whilst I did
it.——I believe, Sir, said he, very modestly, I can
please him best myself.——I am sure, said I, his honour
will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old
soldier.——The youth took hold of my hand, and instantly
burst into tears.——Poor youth! said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—he has been bred up from an infant in the army,
and the name of a soldier, <i>Trim</i>, sounded in his ears
like the name of a friend;—I wish I had him here.</p>

<p>——I never, in the longest march, said the corporal,
had so great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for
company:—What could be the matter with me, an’ please
your honour? Nothing in the world, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, blowing his nose,—but that thou art a
good-natured fellow.</p>

<p>When I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought it
was proper to tell him I was captain <i>Shandy</i>’s servant,
and that your honour (though a stranger) was extremely concerned
for his father;—and that if there was any thing in your house
or cellar——(And thou might’st have added my purse
too, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>),——he was heartily
welcome to it:——He made a very low bow (which was meant
to your honour), but no answer—for his heart was
full—so he went up stairs with the toast;—I warrant
you, my dear, said I, as I opened the kitchen-door, your father
will be well again.——Mr. <i>Yorick</i>’s
curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire,—but said not a
word good or bad to comfort the youth.——I thought it
wrong; added the corporal——I think so too, said my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he
felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen, to
let me know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would
step up stairs.——I believe, said the landlord, he is
going to say his prayers,——for there was a book laid
upon the chair by his bed-side, and as I shut the door, I saw his
son take up a cushion.——</p>

<p>I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr.
<i>Trim</i>, never said your prayers at all.——I heard
the poor gentleman say his prayers last night, said the landlady,
very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed
it.——Are you sure of it? replied the
curate.——A soldier, an’ please your reverence,
said I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a
parson;——and when he is fighting for his king, and for
his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason to
pray to God of any one in the whole world——’Twas
well said of thee, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i>——But when a soldier, said I, an’
please your reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together
in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,—or engaged,
said I, for months together in long and dangerous
marches;—harassed, perhaps, in his rear
to-day;—harassing others to-morrow;—detached
here;—countermanded there;—resting this night out upon
his arms;—beat up in his shirt the next;—benumbed in
his joints;—perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel
on;—must say his prayers <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> he
can.—I believe, said I,—for I was piqued, quoth the
corporal, for the reputation of the army,—I believe,
an’ please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets
time to pray,—he prays as heartily as a parson,—though
not with all his fuss and hypocrisy.——Thou shouldst not
have said that, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—for
God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:——At
the great and general review of us all, corporal, at the day of
judgment (and not till then)—it will be seen who has done
their duties in this world,—and who has not; and we shall be
advanced, <i>Trim</i>, accordingly.——I hope we shall,
said <i>Trim.</i>——It is in the Scripture, said my
uncle <i>Toby;</i> and I will shew it thee to-morrow:—In the
mean time we may depend upon it, <i>Trim</i>, for our comfort, said
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, that God Almighty is so good and just a
governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in
it,—it will never be enquired into, whether we have done them
in a red coat or a black one:——I hope not, said the
corporal——But go on, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, with thy story.</p>

<p>When I went up, continued the corporal, into the
lieutenant’s room, which I did not do till the expiration of
the ten minutes,—he was lying in his bed with his
head raised upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a
clean white cambrick handkerchief beside it:——The youth
was just stooping down to take up the cushion, upon which I
supposed he had been kneeling,—the book was laid upon the
bed,—and, as he rose, in taking up the cushion with one hand,
he reached out his other to take it away at the same
time.——Let it remain there, my dear, said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>He did not offer to speak to me, till I had walked up close to
his bed- side:—If you are captain <i>Shandy</i>’s
servant, said he, you must present my thanks to your master, with
my little boy’s thanks along with them, for his courtesy to
me;—if he was of <i>Levens</i>’s—said the
lieutenant.—I told him your honour was—Then, said he, I
served three campaigns with him in <i>Flanders</i>, and remember
him,—but ’tis most likely, as I had not the honour of
any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me.——You will tell him, however, that
the person his good-nature has laid under obligations to him, is
one <i>Le Fever</i>, a lieutenant in
<i>Angus</i>’s——but he knows me not,—said
he, a second time, musing;——possibly he may my
story—added he—pray tell the captain, I was the ensign
at <i>Breda</i>, whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a
musket-shot, as she lay in my arms in my tent.——I
remember the story, an’t please your honour, said I, very
well.——Do you so? said he, wiping his eyes with his
handkerchief—then well may I.—In saying this, he drew a
little ring out of his bosom, which seemed tied with a black
ribband about his neck, and kiss’d it
twice——Here, <i>Billy</i>, said he,—the boy flew
across the room to the bed-side,—and falling down upon his
knee, took the ring in his hand, and kissed it too,—then
kissed his father, and sat down upon the bed and wept.</p>

<p>I wish, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with a deep sigh,—I
wish, <i>Trim</i>, I was asleep.</p>

<p>Your honour, replied the corporal, is too much
concerned;—shall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to
your pipe?——Do, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>I remember, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, sighing again, the story
of the ensign and his wife, with a circumstance his modesty
omitted;—and particularly well that he, as well as she, upon
some account or other (I forget what) was universally pitied by the
whole regiment;—but finish the story thou art
upon:—’Tis finished already, said the
corporal,—for I could stay no longer,—so wished his
honour a good night; young <i>Le Fever</i> rose from off the bed,
and saw me to the bottom of the stairs; and as we went down
together, told me, they had come from <i>Ireland</i>, and were on
their route to join the regiment in
<i>Flanders.</i>——But alas! said the
corporal,—the lieutenant’s last day’s march is
over.—Then what is to become of his poor boy? cried my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

THE STORY OF LE FEVER CONTINUED
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s eternal honour,——though I tell it
only for the sake of those, who, when coop’d in betwixt a
natural and a positive law, know not, for their souls, which way in
the world to turn themselves——That notwithstanding my
uncle <i>Toby</i> was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on
the siege of <i>Dendermond</i>, parallel with the allies, who
pressed theirs on so vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time
to get his dinner——that nevertheless he gave up
<i>Dendermond</i>, though he had already made a lodgment upon the
counterscarp;—and bent his whole thoughts towards the private
distresses at the inn; and except that he ordered the garden gate
to be bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege
of <i>Dendermond</i> into a blockade,—he left
<i>Dendermond</i> to itself—to be relieved or not by the <i>French</i> king, as the
<i>French</i> king thought good; and only considered how he himself
should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son.</p>

<p>——That kind B<small>EING</small>, who is a friend to
the friendless, shall recompence thee for this.</p>

<p>Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle <i>Toby</i> to
the corporal, as he was putting him to bed,——and I will
tell thee in what, <i>Trim.</i>——In the first place,
when thou madest an offer of my services to <i>Le
Fever</i>,——as sickness and travelling are both
expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with a
son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay,—that thou
didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood
in need, thou knowest, <i>Trim</i>, he had been as welcome to it as
myself.——Your honour knows, said the corporal, I had no
orders;——True, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—thou
didst very right, <i>Trim</i>, as a soldier,—but certainly
very wrong as a man.</p>

<p>In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same
excuse, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——when thou
offeredst him whatever was in my house,——thou shouldst
have offered him my house too:——A sick brother officer
should have the best quarters, <i>Trim</i>, and if we had him with
us,—we could tend and look to him:——Thou art an
excellent nurse thyself, <i>Trim</i>,—and what with thy care
of him, and the old woman’s and his boy’s, and mine
together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his
legs.——</p>

<p>——In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, smiling,——he might march.——He
will never march; an’ please your honour, in this world, said
the corporal:——He will march; said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, rising up from the side of the bed, with one shoe
off:——An’ please your honour, said the corporal,
he will never march but to his grave:——He shall march,
cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, marching the foot which had a shoe on,
though without advancing an inch,—he shall march to his
regiment.——He cannot stand it, said the
corporal;——He shall be supported, said my uncle
<i>Toby;</i>——He’ll drop at last, said the
corporal, and what will become of his boy?——He shall
not drop, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
firmly.——A-well-o’day,—do what we can for
him, said <i>Trim</i>, maintaining his point,—the poor soul
will die:——He shall not die, by G—, cried my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>—The <small>ACCUSING SPIRIT</small>, which flew up to
heaven’s chancery with the oath, blush’d as he gave it
in;—and the <small>RECORDING ANGEL</small>, as he wrote it
down, dropp’d a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for
ever.</p>

physician,—he went to bed, and fell asleep.</p>

THE STORY OF LE FEVER CONTINUED
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> sun looked bright the morning
after, to every eye in the village but <i>Le Fever</i>’s and
his afflicted son’s; the hand of death pressed heavy upon his
eye-lids,——and hardly could the wheel at the cistern
turn round its circle,—when my uncle <i>Toby</i>, who had
rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the
lieutenant’s room, and without preface or apology, sat
himself down upon the chair by the bed-side, and, independently of
all modes and customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old
friend and brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he
did,—how he had rested in the night,—what was his
complaint,—where was his pain,—and what he could do to
help him:——and without giving him time to answer any
one of the enquiries, went on, and told him of the little plan
which he had been concerting with the corporal the night
before for him.——</p>

<p>——You shall go home directly, <i>Le Fever</i>, said
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to my house,—and we’ll send for a
doctor to see what’s the matter,—and we’ll have
an apothecary,—and the corporal shall be your
nurse;——and I’ll be your servant, <i>Le
Fever.</i></p>

<p>There was a frankness in my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—not the
<i>effect</i> of familiarity,—but the cause of
it,—which let you at once into his soul, and shewed you the
goodness of his nature; to this there was something in his looks,
and voice, and manner, superadded, which eternally beckoned to the
unfortunate to come and take shelter under him, so that before my
uncle <i>Toby</i> had half finished the kind offers he was making
to the father, had the son insensibly pressed up close to his
knees, and had taken hold of the breast of his coat, and was
pulling it towards him.——The blood and spirits of <i>Le
Fever</i>, which were waxing cold and slow within him, and were
retreating to their last citadel, the heart—rallied
back,—the film forsook his eyes for a moment,—he looked
up wishfully in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s face,—then cast
a look upon his boy,——and that <i>ligament</i>, fine as
it was,—was never broken.——</p>

<p>Nature instantly ebb’d again,—the film returned to
its place,——the pulse
fluttered——stopp’d——went
on——throbb’d———stopp’d
again——moved——stopp’d——shall
I go on?——No.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIV</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>AM</small> so impatient to return to my own
story, that what remains of young <i>Le Fever</i>’s, that is,
from this turn of his fortune, to the time my uncle <i>Toby</i>
recommended him for my preceptor, shall be told in a very few words
in the next chapter.—All that is necessary to be added to
this chapter is as follows.—</p>

<p>That my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with young <i>Le Fever</i> in his
hand, attended the poor lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his
grave.</p>

<p>That the governor of <i>Dendermond</i> paid his obsequies all
military honours,—and that <i>Yorick</i>, not to be
behind-hand—paid him all ecclesiastic—for he buried him
in his chancel:—And it appears likewise, he preached a
funeral sermon over him——I say it
<i>appears</i>,—for it was <i>Yorick</i>’s custom,
which I suppose a general one with those of his profession, on the
first leaf of every sermon which he composed, to chronicle down the
time, the place, and the occasion of its being preached: to this,
he was ever wont to add some short comment or stricture upon the
sermon itself, seldom, indeed, much to its credit:—For
instance, <i>This sermon upon the Jewish dispensation—I
don’t like it at all;—Though I own there is a world
of</i> <small>WATER-LANDISH</small> <i>knowledge in it;—but
’tis all tritical, and most tritically put
together.—This is but a flimsy kind of a composition; what
was in my head when I made it?</i></p>

<p>——N.B. <i>The excellency of this text is, that it
will suit any sermon,—and of this sermon,——that
it will suit any text.——</i></p>

<p>——<i>For this sermon I shall be
hanged,—for I have stolen the greatest part of it. Doctor</i>
Paidagunes <i>found me out. =&gt; Set a thief to catch a
thief.——</i></p>

<p>On the back of half a dozen I find written, So, so, and no
more——and upon a couple <i>Moderato;</i> by which, as
far as one may gather from <i>Altieri’s Italian</i>
dictionary,—but mostly from the authority of a piece of green
whipcord, which seemed to have been the unravelling of
<i>Yorick</i>’s whip-lash, with which he has left us the two
sermons marked <i>Moderato</i>, and the half dozen of <i>So,
so</i>, tied fast together in one bundle by themselves,—one
may safely suppose he meant pretty near the same thing.</p>

<p>There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture, which
is this, that the <i>moderato</i>’s are five times better
than the <i>so, so</i>’s;—show ten times more knowledge
of the human heart;—have seventy times more wit and spirit in
them;—(and, to rise properly in my climax)—discovered a
thousand times more genius;—and to crown all, are infinitely
more entertaining than those tied up with them:—for
which reason, whene’er <i>Yorick’s dramatic</i> sermons
are offered to the world, though I shall admit but one out of the
whole number of the <i>so, so</i>’s, I shall, nevertheless,
adventure to print the two <i>moderato</i>’s without any sort
of scruple.</p>

<p>What <i>Yorick</i> could mean by the words
<i>lentamente,—tenutè,—grave</i>,—and
sometimes <i>adagio</i>,—as applied to <i>theological</i>
compositions, and with which he has characterised some of these
sermons, I dare not venture to guess.——I am more
puzzled still upon finding <i>a l’octava alta!</i> upon
one;——<i>Con strepito</i> upon the back of
another;——<i>Scicilliana</i> upon a
third;——<i>Alla capella</i> upon a
fourth;——<i>Con l’arco</i> upon
this;——<i>Senza l’arco</i> upon
that.——All I know is, that they are musical terms, and
have a meaning;——and as he was a musical man, I will
make no doubt, but that by some quaint application of such
metaphors to the compositions in hand, they impressed very distinct
ideas of their several characters upon his fancy,—whatever
they may do upon that of others.</p>

<p>Amongst these, there is that particular sermon which has
unaccountably led me into this digression——The funeral
sermon upon poor <i>Le Fever</i>, wrote out very fairly, as if from
a hasty copy.—I take notice of it the more, because it seems
to have been his favourite composition——It is upon
mortality; and is tied length-ways and cross-ways with a yarn
thrum, and then rolled up and twisted round with a half-sheet of
dirty blue paper, which seems to have been once the cast cover of a
general review, which to this day smells horribly of horse
drugs.——Whether these marks of humiliation were
designed,—I something doubt;——because at the end
of the sermon (and not at the beginning of it)—very different
from his way of treating the rest, he had wrote——</p>

<p class="center">Bravo!</p>

<p>——Though not very offensively,——for it
is at two inches, at least, and a half’s distance from, and
below the concluding line of the sermon, at the very extremity of
the page, and in that right hand corner of it, which, you know, is
generally covered with your thumb; and, to do it justice, it is
wrote besides with a crow’s quill so faintly in a small
<i>Italian</i> hand, as scarce to solicit the eye towards the
place, whether your thumb is there or not,—so that from the
<i>manner of it</i>, it stands half excused; and being wrote
moreover with very pale ink, diluted almost to
nothing,—’tis more like a <i>ritratto</i> of the shadow
of vanity, than of V<small>ANITY</small> herself—of the two;
resembling rather a faint thought of transient applause, secretly
stirring up in the heart of the composer; than a gross mark of it,
coarsely obtruded upon the world.</p>

<p>With all these extenuations, I am aware, that in publishing
this, I do no service to <i>Yorick</i>’s character as a
modest man;—but all men have their failings! and what lessens
this still farther, and almost wipes it away, is this; that the
word was struck through sometime afterwards (as appears from a
different tint of the ink) with a line quite across it in this manner,
BRAVO——as if he had retracted, or was
ashamed of the opinion he had once entertained of it.</p>

<p>These short characters of his sermons were always written,
excepting in this one instance, upon the first leaf of his sermon,
which served as a cover to it; and usually upon the inside of it,
which was turned towards the text;—but at the end of his
discourse, where, perhaps, he had five or six pages, and sometimes,
perhaps, a whole score to turn himself in,—he took a large
circuit, and, indeed, a much more mettlesome one;—as if he
had snatched the occasion of unlacing himself with a few more
frolicksome strokes at vice, than the straitness of the pulpit
allowed.—These, though hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and
out of all order, are still auxiliaries on the side of
virtue;—tell me then, Mynheer Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke, why they should not be printed
together?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;lV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>hen</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> had turned
every thing into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent
of the regiment and <i>Le Fever</i>, and betwixt <i>Le Fever</i>
and all mankind,——there remained nothing more in my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s hands, than an old regimental coat and a
sword; so that my uncle <i>Toby</i> found little or no opposition
from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle
<i>Toby</i> gave the corporal;——Wear it, <i>Trim</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as long as it will hold together, for
the sake of the poor lieutenant——And
this,——said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, taking up the sword
in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he
spoke——and this, <i>Le Fever</i>, I’ll save for
thee,—’tis all the fortune, continued my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to
it,—’tis all the fortune, my dear <i>Le Fever</i>,
which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way
with it in the world,—and thou doest it like a man of
honour,—’tis enough for us.</p>

<p>As soon as my uncle <i>Toby</i> had laid a foundation, and
taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him
to a public school, where, excepting <i>Whitsontide</i> and
<i>Christmas</i>, at which times the corporal was punctually
dispatched for him,—he remained to the spring of the year,
seventeen; when the stories of the emperor’s sending his army
into <i>Hungary</i> against the <i>Turks</i>, kindling a spark of
fire in his bosom, he left his <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>
without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, begged his father’s sword, and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s leave along with it, to go and try his fortune
under <i>Eugene.</i>—Twice did my uncle <i>Toby</i> forget
his wound and cry out, <i>Le Fever!</i> I will go with thee, and
thou shalt fight beside me——And twice he laid his hand
upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and
disconsolation.——</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> took down the sword from the
crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the
lieutenant’s death, and delivered it to the corporal to
brighten up;——and having detained <i>Le Fever</i> a
single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to
<i>Leghorn</i>,—he put the sword into his
hand.——If thou art brave, <i>Le Fever</i>, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, this will not fail thee,——but
Fortune, said he (musing a little),——Fortune
may——And if she does,—added my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
embracing him, come back again to me, <i>Le Fever</i>, and we will
shape thee another course.</p>

<p>The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of <i>Le
Fever</i> more than my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s paternal
kindness;——he parted from my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as the
best of sons from the best of fathers——both dropped
tears——and as my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave him his last
kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his
father’s, in which was his mother’s ring, into his
hand,—and bid God bless him.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>L<small>E</small> F<small>EVER</small> got up to the
Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made
of, at the defeat of the <i>Turks</i> before <i>Belgrade;</i> but a
series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment,
and trod close upon his heels for four years together after; he had
withstood these buffetings to the last, till sickness overtook him
at <i>Marseilles</i>, from whence he wrote my uncle <i>Toby</i>
word, he had lost his time, his services, his health, and, in
short, every thing but his sword;——and was waiting for
the first ship to return back to him.</p>

<p>As this letter came to hand about six weeks before
<i>Susannah</i>’s accident, <i>Le Fever</i> was hourly
expected; and was uppermost in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s mind
all the time my father was giving him and <i>Yorick</i> a
description of what kind of a person he would chuse for a preceptor
to me: but as my uncle <i>Toby</i> thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the
accomplishments he required, he forbore mentioning <i>Le
Fever</i>’s name,——till the character, by
<i>Yorick</i>’s inter-position, ending unexpectedly, in one,
who should be gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed
the image of <i>Le Fever</i>, and his interest, upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i> so forcibly, he rose instantly off his chair; and
laying down his pipe, in order to take hold of both my
father’s hands——I beg, brother <i>Shandy</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I may recommend poor <i>Le
Fever</i>’s son to you—I beseech you do, added
<i>Yorick</i>——He has a good heart, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——And a brave one too, an’ please your
honour, said the corporal.</p>

<p>——The best hearts, <i>Trim</i>, are ever the
bravest, replied my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——And the
greatest cowards, an’ please your honour, in our regiment,
were the greatest rascals in it.—There was serjeant
<i>Kumber</i>, and ensign——</p>

<p>——We’ll talk of them, said my father, another
time.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

<p>W<small>HAT</small> a jovial and a merry world would
this be, may it please your worships, but for that inextricable
labyrinth of debts, cares, woes, want, grief, discontent,
melancholy, large jointures, impositions, and lies!</p>

<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i>, like a son of a w——, as my
father called him for it,—to exalt himself,—debased me
to death,—and made ten thousand times more of
<i>Susannah</i>’s accident, than there was any grounds for;
so that in a week’s time, or less, it was in every
body’s mouth, <i>That poor Master Shandy</i> * * * * * * * *
* * * * entirely.—And F<small>AME</small>, who loves to
double every thing,—in three days more, had sworn, positively
she saw it,—and all the world, as usual, gave credit to her
evidence——“That the nursery window had not
only * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ;—but
that * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ’s
also.”</p>

<p>Could the world have been sued like a
<small>BODY-CORPORATE</small>,—my father had brought an
action upon the case, and trounced it sufficiently; but to fall
foul of individuals about it——as every soul who had
mentioned the affair, did it with the greatest pity
imaginable;——’twas like flying in the very face
of his best friends:——And yet to acquiesce under the
report, in silence—was to acknowledge it openly,—at
least in the opinion of one half of the world; and to make a bustle
again, in contradicting it,—was to confirm it as strongly in
the opinion of the other half.——</p>

<p>——Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so
hampered? said my father.</p>

<p>I would shew him publickly, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, at the
market cross.</p>

<p>——’Twill have no effect, said my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——I’ll put him, however, into
breeches, said my father,—let the world say what it will.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIX</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> are a thousand resolutions,
Sir, both in church and state, as well as in matters, Madam, of a
more private concern;—which, though they have carried all the
appearance in the world of being taken, and entered upon in a
hasty, hare-brained, and unadvised manner, were, notwithstanding
this, (and could you or I have got into the cabinet, or stood
behind the curtain, we should have found it was so) weighed,
poized, and perpended——argued
upon——canvassed through——entered into, and
examined on all sides with so much coolness, that the
<small>GODDESS OF COOLNESS</small> herself (I do not take upon me
to prove her existence) could neither have wished it, or done it
better.</p>

<p>Of the number of these was my father’s resolution of
putting me into breeches; which, though determined at
once,—in a kind of huff, and a defiance of all mankind, had,
nevertheless, been <i>pro’d</i> and <i>conn’d</i>, and
judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month
before, in two several <i>beds of justice</i>, which my father had
held for that purpose. I shall explain the nature of these beds of
justice in my next chapter; and in the chapter following that, you
shall step with me, Madam, behind the curtain, only to hear in what
kind of manner my father and my mother debated between themselves,
this affair of the breeches,—from which you may form an idea,
how they debated all lesser matters.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LX</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> ancient <i>Goths</i> of
<i>Germany</i>, who (the learned <i>Cluverius</i> is positive) were
first seated in the country between the <i>Vistula</i> and the
<i>Oder</i>, and who afterwards incorporated the <i>Herculi</i>, the
<i>Bugians</i>, and some other <i>Vandallick</i> clans to
’em—had all of them a wise custom of debating every
thing of importance to their state, twice, that is,—once
drunk, and once sober:——Drunk—that their councils
might not want vigour;——and sober—that they might
not want discretion.</p>

<p>Now my father being entirely a water-drinker,—was a long
time gravelled almost to death, in turning this as much to his
advantage, as he did every other thing which the ancients did or
said; and it was not till the seventh year of his marriage, after a
thousand fruitless experiments and devices, that he hit upon an
expedient which answered the purpose;——and that was,
when any difficult and momentous point was to be settled in the
family, which required great sobriety, and great spirit too, in its
determination,——he fixed and set apart the first
<i>Sunday</i> night in the month, and the <i>Saturday</i> night
which immediately preceded it, to argue it over, in bed with my mother: By which contrivance, if you
consider, Sir, with yourself, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>These my father, humorously enough, called his <i>beds of
justice;</i>——for from the two different counsels taken
in these two different humours, a middle one was generally found
out which touched the point of wisdom as well, as if he had got
drunk and sober a hundred times.</p>

<p>I must not be made a secret of to the world, that this answers
full as well in literary discussions, as either in military or
conjugal; but it is not every author that can try the experiment as
the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i> did it——or, if he
can, may it be always for his body’s health; and to do it, as
my father did it,—am I sure it would be always for his
soul’s.</p>

<p>My way is this:——</p>

<p>In all nice and ticklish discussions,—(of which, heaven
knows, there are but too many in my book)—where I find I
cannot take a step without the danger of having either their
worships or their reverences upon my back——I write
one-half <i>full</i>,—and t’other
<i>fasting;</i>——or write it all full,—and
correct it fasting;——or write it fasting,—and
correct it full, for they all come to the same
thing:——So that with a less variation from my
father’s plan, than my father’s from the
<i>Gothick</i>—I feel myself upon a par with him in his first
bed of justice,—and no way inferior to him in his
second.——These different and almost irreconcileable
effects, flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful mechanism of
nature,—of which,—be her’s the
honour.——All that we can do, is to turn and work the
machine to the improvement and better manufactory of the arts and
sciences.——</p>

<p>Now, when I write full,—I write as if I was never to write
fasting again as long as I live;——that is, I write free
from the cares as well as the terrors of the
world.——I count not the number of my scars,—nor
does my fancy go forth into dark entries and bye-corners to
ante-date my stabs.——In a word, my pen takes its
course; and I write on as much from the fulness of my heart, as my
stomach.——</p>

<p>But when, an’ please your honours, I indite fasting,
’tis a different history.——I pay the world all
possible attention and respect,—and have as great a share
(whilst it lasts) of that under strapping virtue of discretion as
the best of you.——So that betwixt both, I write a
careless kind of a civil, nonsensical, good-humoured
<i>Shandean</i> book, which will do all your hearts
good——</p>

<p>——And all your heads too,—provided you
understand it.</p>

<p>W<small>E</small> should begin, said my father,
turning himself half round in bed, and shifting his pillow a little
towards my mother’s, as he opened the debate——We
should begin to think, Mrs. <i>Shandy</i>, of putting this boy into
breeches.——</p>

<p>We should so,—said my mother.——We defer it, my
dear, quoth my father, shamefully.——</p>

<p>I think we do, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>,—said my mother.</p>

<p>——Not but the child looks extremely well, said my
father, in his vests and tunicks.——</p>

<p>——He does look very well in them,—replied my
mother.——</p>

<p>——And for that reason it would be almost a sin,
added my father, to take him out of ’em.——</p>

<p>——It would so,—said my
mother:——But indeed he is growing a very tall
lad,—rejoined my father.</p>

<p>——He is very tall for his age, indeed,—said my
mother.——</p>

<p>——I can not (making two syllables of it) imagine,
quoth my father, who the deuce he takes after.——</p>

<p>I cannot conceive, for my life, said my
mother.——</p>

<p>Humph!——said my father.</p>

<p>(The dialogue ceased for a moment.)</p>

<p>——(I am very short myself,—continued my father
gravely.</p>

<p>You are very short, Mr <i>Shandy</i>,—said my mother.</p>

<p>Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering
which, he plucked his pillow a little further from my
mother’s,—and turning about again, there was an end of
the debate for three minutes and a half.</p>

<p>——When he gets these breeches made, cried my father
in a higher tone, he’ll look like a beast in ’em.</p>

<p>He will be very awkward in them at first, replied my mother.</p>

<p>——And ’twill be lucky, if that’s the
worst on’t, added my father.</p>

<p>It will be very lucky, answered my mother.</p>

<p>I suppose, replied my father,—making some pause
first,—he’ll be exactly like other people’s
children.——</p>

<p>Exactly, said my mother.——</p>

<p>——Though I shall be sorry for that, added my father:
and so the debate stopp’d again.</p>

<p>——They should be of leather, said my father, turning
him about again.—</p>

<p>They will last him, said my mother, the longest.</p>

<p>But he can have no linings to ’em, replied my
father.——</p>

<p>He cannot, said my mother.</p>

<p>’Twere better to have them of fustian, quoth my
father.</p>

<p>Nothing can be better, quoth my mother.——</p>

<p>——Except dimity,—replied my
father:——’Tis best of all,—replied my
mother.</p>

<p>——One must not give him his death,
however,—interrupted my father.</p>

<p>By no means, said my mother:——and so the dialogue
stood still again.</p>

<p>I am resolved, however, quoth my father, breaking silence the
fourth time, he shall have no pockets in them.——</p>

<p>——There is no occasion for any, said my
mother.——</p>

<p>I mean in his coat and waistcoat,—cried my father.</p>

<p>——I mean so too,—replied my mother.</p>

<p>——Though if he gets a gig or top——Poor
souls! it is a crown and a sceptre to them,—they should have
where to secure it.——</p>

<p>Order it as you please, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, replied my
mother.——</p>

<p>——But don’t you think it right? added my
father, pressing the point home to her.</p>

<p>Perfectly, said my mother, if it pleases you, Mr.
<i>Shandy.</i>——</p>

<p>——There’s for you! cried my father, losing his
temper——Pleases me!——You never will
distinguish, Mrs. <i>Shandy</i>, nor shall I ever teach you to do it, betwixt a point of
pleasure and a point of convenience.——This was on the
<i>Sunday</i> night:——and further this chapter sayeth
not.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>FTER</small> my father had debated the
affair of the breeches with my mother,—he consulted
<i>Albertus Rubenius</i> upon it; and <i>Albertus Rubenius</i> used
my father ten times worse in the consultation (if possible) than
even my father had used my mother: For as <i>Rubenius</i> had wrote
a quarto <i>express, De re Vestiaria Veterum</i>,—it was
<i>Rubenius</i>’s business to have given my father some
lights.—On the contrary, my father might as well have thought
of extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long
beard,—as of extracting a single word out of <i>Rubenius</i>
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Upon every other article of ancient dress, <i>Rubenius</i> was
very communicative to my father;—gave him a full satisfactory
account of</p>

<p>The Toga, or loose gown.</p>

<p>The Chlamys.</p>

<p>The Ephod.</p>

<p>The Tunica, or Jacket.</p>

<p>The Synthesis.</p>

<p>The Pænula.</p>

<p>The Lacema, with its Cucullus.</p>

<p>The Paludamentum.</p>

<p>The Prætexta.</p>

<p>The Sagum, or soldier’s jerkin.</p>

<p>The Trabea: of which, according to <i>Suetonius</i>,
there was three kinds.—</p>

<p>——But what are all these to the breeches? said my
father.</p>

<p><i>Rubenius</i> threw him down upon the counter all kinds of
shoes which had been in fashion with the
<i>Romans.</i>——</p>

<p>There was,</p>

<p>The open shoe.</p>

<p>The close shoe.</p>

<p>The slip shoe.</p>

<p>The wooden shoe.</p>

<p>The soc.</p>

<p>The buskin.</p>

<p>And The military shoe with hobnails in it, which
<i>Juvenal</i> takes notice of.</p>

<p>There were, The clogs.</p>

<p>The pattins.</p>

<p>The pantoufles.</p>

<p>The brogues.</p>

<p>The sandals, with latchets to them.</p>

<p>There was, The felt shoe.</p>

<p>The linen shoe.</p>

<p>The laced shoe.</p>

<p>The braided shoe.</p>

<p>The calceus incisus.</p>

<p>And The calceus rostratus.</p>

<p><i>Rubenius</i> shewed my father how well they all
fitted,—in what manner they laced on,—with what points,
straps, thongs, latchets, ribbands, jaggs, and
ends.——</p>

<p>——But I want to be informed about the breeches, said
my father.</p>

<p><i>Albertus Rubenius</i> informed my father that the
<i>Romans</i> manufactured stuffs of various
fabrics,——some plain,—some striped,—others diapered throughout the whole
contexture of the wool, with silk and gold——That linen
did not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of
the empire, when the <i>Egyptians</i> coming to settle amongst
them, brought it into vogue.</p>

<p>——That persons of quality and fortune distinguished
themselves by the fineness and whiteness of their clothes; which
colour (next to purple, which was appropriated to the great
offices) they most affected, and wore on their birth-days and
public rejoicings.——That it appeared from the best
historians of those times, that they frequently sent their clothes
to the fuller, to be clean’d and whitened:——but
that the inferior people, to avoid that expence, generally wore
brown clothes, and of a something coarser texture,—till
towards the beginning of <i>Augustus</i>’s reign, when the
slave dressed like his master, and almost every distinction of
habiliment was lost, but the <i>Latus Clavus.</i></p>

<p>And what was the <i>Latus Clavus?</i> said my father.</p>

<p><i>Rubenius</i> told him, that the point was still litigating
amongst the learned:——That <i>Egnatius, Sigonius,
Bossius Ticinensis, Bayfius Budæus, Salmasius, Lipsius,
Lazius, Isaac Casaubon</i>, and <i>Joseph Scaliger</i>, all
differed from each other,—and he from them: That some took it
to be the button,—some the coat itself,—others only the
colour of it;—That the great <i>Bayfuis</i> in his Wardrobe
of the Ancients, chap. 12—honestly said, he knew not what it
was,—whether a tibula,—a stud,—a button,—a
loop,—a buckle,—or clasps and
keepers.——</p>

<p>——My father lost the horse, but not the
saddle——They are <i>hooks and eyes</i>, said my
father——and with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches
to be made.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>E</small> are now going to enter upon a new
scene of events.——</p>

<p>——Leave we then the breeches in the taylor’s
hands, with my father standing over him with his cane, reading him
as he sat at work a lecture upon the <i>latus clavus</i>, and
pointing to the precise part of the waistband, where he was
determined to have it sewed on.——</p>

<p>Leave we my mother—(truest of all the
<i>Poco-curante</i>’s of her sex!)—careless about it,
as about every thing else in the world which concerned
her;—that is,—indifferent whether it was done this way
or that,——provided it was but done at
all.——</p>

<p>Leave we <i>Slop</i> likewise to the full profits of all my
dishonours.——</p>

<p>Leave we poor <i>Le Fever</i> to recover, and get home from
<i>Marseilles</i> as he can.——And last of
all,—because the hardest of all——</p>

<p>Let us leave, if possible, <i>myself:</i>——But
’tis impossible,—I must go along with you to the end of
the work.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>F</small> the reader has not a clear
conception of the rood and the half of ground which lay at the
bottom of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s kitchen-garden, and which
was the scene of so many of his delicious hours,—the fault is
not in me,—but in his imagination;—for I am sure I gave
him so minute a description, I was almost ashamed of it.</p>

<p>When F<small>ATE</small> was looking forwards one afternoon,
into the great transactions of future times,—and recollected
for what purposes this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in
iron, had been destined,—she gave a nod to
N<small>ATURE</small>,—’twas enough—Nature threw
half a spade full of her kindliest compost upon it, with just so
<i>much</i> clay in it, as to retain the forms of angles and
indentings,—and so <i>little</i> of it too, as not to cling
to the spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty in foul
weather.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> came down, as the reader has been informed,
with plans along with him, of almost every fortified town in
<i>Italy</i> and <i>Flanders;</i> so let the duke of
<i>Marlborough</i>, or the allies, have set down before what town
they pleased, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was prepared for them.</p>

<p>His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as
soon as ever a town was invested—(but sooner when the design
was known) to take the plan of it (let it be what town it would),
and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact size of his bowling-green;
upon the surface of which, by means of a large role of packthread,
and a number of small piquets driven into the ground, at the
several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his paper;
then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine
the depths and slopes of the ditches,—the talus of the
glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets,
&amp;c.—he set the corporal to work——and sweetly went it
on:——The nature of the soil,—the nature of the
work itself,—and above all, the good-nature of my uncle
<i>Toby</i> sitting by from morning to night, and chatting kindly
with the corporal upon past- done deeds,—left
<small>LABOUR</small> little else but the ceremony of the name.</p>

<p>When the place was finished in this manner, and put into a
proper posture of defence,—it was invested,—and my
uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal began to run their first
parallel.—I beg I may not be interrupted in my story, by
being told, <i>That the first parallel should be at least three
hundred toises distant from the main body of the place,—and
that I have not left a single inch for it;</i>——for my
uncle <i>Toby</i> took the liberty of incroaching upon his
kitchen-garden, for the sake of enlarging his works on the
bowling-green, and for that reason generally ran his first and
second parallels betwixt two rows of his cabbages and his
cauliflowers; the conveniences and inconveniences of which will be
considered at large in the history of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s and the corporal’s campaigns, of which,
this I’m now writing is but a sketch, and will be finished,
if I conjecture right, in three pages (but there is no
guessing)——The campaigns themselves will take up as
many books; and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great
a weight of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this,
to rhapsodize them, as I once intended, into the body of the
work——surely they had better be printed
apart,——we’ll consider the affair——so
take the following sketch of them in the mean time.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> the town, with its works, was
finished, my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal began to run their
first parallel——not at random, or any
how——but from the same points and distances the allies
had begun to run theirs; and regulating their approaches and
attacks, by the accounts my uncle <i>Toby</i> received
from the daily papers,—they went on, during the whole siege,
step by step with the allies.</p>

<p>When the duke of <i>Marlborough</i> made a
lodgment,——my uncle <i>Toby</i> made a lodgment
too.——And when the face of a bastion was battered down,
or a defence ruined,—the corporal took his mattock and did as
much,—and so on;——gaining ground, and making
themselves masters of the works one after another, till the town
fell into their hands.</p>

<p>To one who took pleasure in the happy state of
others,—there could not have been a greater sight in world,
than on a post morning, in which a practicable breach had been made
by the duke of <i>Marlborough</i>, in the main body of the
place,—to have stood behind the horn-beam hedge, and observed
the spirit with which my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with <i>Trim</i> behind
him, sallied forth;——the one with the <i>Gazette</i> in
his hand,—the other with a spade on his shoulder to execute the contents.——What an honest
triumph in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s looks as he marched up to
the ramparts! What intense pleasure swimming in his eye as he stood
over the corporal, reading the paragraph ten times over to him, as
he was at work, lest, peradventure, he should make the breach an
inch too wide,—or leave it an inch too
narrow.——But when the <i>chamade</i> was beat, and the
corporal helped my uncle up it, and followed with the colours in
his hand, to fix them upon the ramparts—Heaven! Earth!
Sea!——but what avails apostrophes?——with
all your elements, wet or dry, ye never compounded so intoxicating
a draught.</p>

<p>In this track of happiness for many years, without one
interruption to it, except now and then when the wind continued to
blow due west for a week or ten days together, which detained the
<i>Flanders</i> mail, and kept them so long in torture,—but
still ’twas the torture of the happy——In this
track, I say, did my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> move for
many years, every year of which, and sometimes every
month, from the invention of either the one or the other of them,
adding some new conceit or quirk of improvement to their
operations, which always opened fresh springs of delight in
carrying them on.</p>

<p>The first year’s campaign was carried on from beginning to
end, in the plain and simple method I’ve related.</p>

<p>In the second year, in which my uncle <i>Toby</i> took
<i>Liege</i> and <i>Ruremond</i>, he thought he might afford the
expence of four handsome draw-bridges; of two of which I have given
an exact description in the former part of my work.</p>

<p>At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates
with port-cullises:——These last were converted
afterwards into orgues, as the better thing; and during the winter
of the same year, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, instead of a new suit of
clothes, which he always had at <i>Christmas</i>, treated himself
with a handsome sentry-box, to stand at the corner of the
bowling-green, betwixt which point and the foot of the glacis, there was left a little kind
of an esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold
councils of war upon.</p>

<p>——The sentry-box was in case of rain.</p>

<p>All these were painted white three times over the ensuing
spring, which enabled my uncle <i>Toby</i> to take the field with
great splendour.</p>

<p>My father would often say to <i>Yorick</i>, that if any mortal
in the whole universe had done such a thing except his brother
<i>Toby</i>, it would have been looked upon by the world as one of
the most refined satires upon the parade and prancing manner in
which <i>Lewis</i> XIV. from the beginning of the war, but
particularly that very year, had taken the field——But
’tis not my brother <i>Toby</i>’s nature, kind soul! my
father would add, to insult any one.</p>

<p>——But let us go on.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>MUST</small> observe, that although in the
first year’s campaign, the word town is often
mentioned,—yet there was no town at that time within the
polygon; that addition was not made till the summer following the
spring in which the bridges and sentry-box were painted, which was
the third year of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
campaigns,—when upon his taking <i>Amberg, Bonn</i>, and
<i>Rhinberg</i>, and <i>Huy</i> and <i>Limbourg</i>, one after
another, a thought came into the corporal’s head, that to
talk of taking so many towns, <i>without one</i>
<small>TOWN</small> <i>to shew for it</i>,—was a very
nonsensical way of going to work, and so proposed to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, that they should have a little model of a town built
for them,—to be run up together of slit deals, and then
painted, and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for
all.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> felt the good of the project instantly, and
instantly agreed to it, but with the addition of two singular
improvements, of which he was almost as proud as if he had been the
original inventor of the project itself.</p>

<p>The one was, to have the town built exactly in the style of
those of which it was most likely to be the
representative:——with grated windows, and the gable
ends of the houses, facing the streets, &amp;c. &amp;c.—as
those in <i>Ghent</i> and <i>Bruges</i>, and the rest of the towns
in <i>Brabant</i> and <i>Flanders.</i></p>

<p>The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the
corporal proposed, but to have every house independent, to hook on,
or off, so as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased.
This was put directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual
congratulation was exchanged between my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the
corporal, as the carpenter did the work.</p>

<p>——It answered prodigiously the next
summer——the town was a perfect
<i>Proteus</i>——It was <i>Landen</i>, and
<i>Trerebach</i>, and <i>Santvliet</i>, and <i>Drusen</i>, and
<i>Hagenau</i>,—and then it was <i>Ostend</i> and
<i>Menin</i>, and <i>Aeth</i> and <i>Dendermond.</i></p>

<p>——Surely never did any <small>TOWN</small> act so
many parts, since <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i>, as my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s town did.</p>

<p>In the fourth year, my uncle <i>Toby</i> thinking a town looked
foolishly without a church, added a very fine one with a
steeple.——<i>Trim</i> was for having bells in
it;——my uncle <i>Toby</i> said, the metal had better be
cast into cannon.</p>

<p>This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass
field-pieces, to be planted three and three on each side of my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s sentry-box; and in a short time, these
led the way for a train of somewhat larger,—and so
on—(as must always be the case in hobby-horsical affairs)
from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came at last to my
father’s jack boots.</p>

<p>The next year, which was that in which <i>Lisle</i> was
besieged, and at the close of which both <i>Ghent</i> and
<i>Bruges</i> fell into our hands,—my uncle <i>Toby</i> was
sadly put to it for <i>proper</i> ammunition;——I say
proper ammunition——because his great artillery would not bear powder; and
’twas well for the <i>Shandy</i> family they would
not——For so full were the papers, from the beginning to
the end of the siege, of the incessant firings kept up by the
besiegers,——and so heated was my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s imagination with the accounts of them, that he
had infallibly shot away all his estate.</p>

<p>S<small>OMETHING</small> therefore was wanting as a
<i>succedaneum</i>, especially in one or two of the more violent
paroxysms of the siege, to keep up something like a continual
firing in the imagination,——and this something, the
corporal, whose principal strength lay in invention, supplied by an
entire new system of battering of his own,—without which,
this had been objected to by military critics, to the end of the
world, as one of the great <i>desiderata</i> of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s apparatus.</p>

<p>This will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as I
generally do, at a little distance from the subject.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>ITH</small> two or three other trinkets,
small in themselves, but of great regard, which poor <i>Tom</i>,
the corporal’s unfortunate brother, had sent him over, with
the account of his marriage with the <i>Jew</i>’s
widow——there was</p>

<p>A <i>Montero</i>-cap and two <i>Turkish</i> tobacco-pipes.</p>

<p>The <i>Montero</i>-cap I shall describe by and bye.—The
<i>Turkish</i> tobacco-pipes had nothing particular in them, they
were fitted up and ornamented as usual, with flexible tubes of
<i>Morocco</i> leather and gold wire, and mounted at their ends,
the one of them with ivory,—the other with black ebony,
tipp’d with silver.</p>

<p>My father, who saw all things in lights different from the rest
of the world, would say to the corporal, that he ought to look upon
these two presents more as tokens of his brother’s
nicety, than his affection.——Tom did not care,
<i>Trim</i>, he would say, to put on the cap, or to smoke in the
tobacco-pipe of a <i>Jew.</i>——God bless your honour,
the corporal would say (giving a strong reason to the
contrary)—how can that be?</p>

<p>The Montero-cap was scarlet, of a superfine <i>Spanish</i>
cloth, dyed in grain, and mounted all round with fur, except about
four inches in the front, which was faced with a light blue,
slightly embroidered,—and seemed to have been the property of
a <i>Portuguese</i> quarter-master, not of foot, but of horse, as
the word denotes.</p>

<p>The corporal was not a little proud of it, as well for its own
sake, as the sake of the giver, so seldom or never put it on but
upon G<small>ALA</small>-days; and yet never was a Montero-cap put
to so many uses; for in all controverted points, whether military
or culinary, provided the corporal was sure he was in the
right,—it was either his <i>oath</i>,—his
<i>wager</i>,—or his <i>gift.</i></p>

<p>——’Twas his gift in the present case.</p>

<p>I’ll be bound, said the corporal, speaking to himself, to
give away my Montero-cap to the first beggar who comes to the door,
if I do not manage this matter to his honour’s
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The completion was no further off, than the very next morning;
which was that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the
<i>Lower Deule</i>, to the right, and the gate St.
<i>Andrew</i>,—and on the left, between St.
<i>Magdalen</i>’s and the river.</p>

<p>As this was the most memorable attack in the whole
war,—the most gallant and obstinate on both sides,—and
I must add the most bloody too, for it cost the allies themselves
that morning above eleven hundred men,—my uncle <i>Toby</i>
prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity.</p>

<p>The eve which preceded, as my uncle <i>Toby</i> went to bed, he
ordered his ramallie wig, which had laid inside out for many years
in the corner of an old campaigning trunk, which stood by his
bedside, to be taken out and laid upon the lid of it, ready for the morning;—and the
very first thing he did in his shirt, when he had stepped out of
bed, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, after he had turned the rough side
outwards,—put it on:——This done, he proceeded
next to his breeches, and having buttoned the waist-band, he
forthwith buckled on his sword-belt, and had got his sword half way
in,—when he considered he should want shaving, and that it
would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword on,—so
took it off:——In essaying to put on his regimental coat
and waistcoat, my uncle <i>Toby</i> found the same objection in his
wig,—so that went off too:—So that what with one thing
and what with another, as always falls out when a man is in the
most haste,—’twas ten o’clock, which was half an
hour later than his usual time, before my uncle <i>Toby</i> sallied
out.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i> had scarce
turned the corner of his yew hedge, which separated his
kitchen-garden from his bowling-green, when he perceived the
corporal had begun the attack without him.——</p>

<p>Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal’s
apparatus; and of the corporal himself in the height of his attack,
just as it struck my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as he turned towards the
sentry-box, where the corporal was at work,——for in
nature there is not such another,——nor can any
combination of all that is grotesque and whimsical in her works
produce its equal.</p>

<p>The corporal———</p>

<p>——Tread lightly on his ashes, ye men of
genius,——for he was your kinsman:</p>

<p>Weed his grave clean, ye men of goodness,—for he was your
brother.—Oh corporal! had I thee, but now,—now, that I am able to give thee a dinner and
protection,—how would I cherish thee! thou should’st
wear thy Montero-cap every hour of the day, and every day of the
week.—and when it was worn out, I would purchase thee a
couple like it:——But alas! alas! alas! now that I can
do this in spite of their reverences—the occasion is
lost—for thou art gone;—thy genius fled up to the stars
from whence it came;—and that warm heart of thine, with all
its generous and open vessels, compressed into a <i>clod of the
valley!</i></p>

<p>——But what——what is this, to that future
and dreaded page, where I look towards the velvet pall, decorated
with the military ensigns of thy master—the first—the
foremost of created beings;——where, I shall see thee,
faithful servant! laying his sword and scabbard with a trembling
hand across his coffin, and then returning pale as ashes to the
door, to take his mourning horse by the bridle, to follow his
hearse, as he directed thee;——where—all my
father’s systems shall be baffled by his sorrows; and, in spite of his
philosophy, I shall behold him, as he inspects the lackered plate,
twice taking his spectacles from off his nose, to wipe away the dew
which nature has shed upon them——When I see him cast in
the rosemary with an air of disconsolation, which cries through my
ears,——O <i>Toby!</i> in what corner of the world
shall I seek thy fellow?</p>

<p>——Gracious powers! which erst have opened the lips
of the dumb in his distress, and made the tongue of the stammerer
speak plain—when I shall arrive at this dreaded page, deal
not with me, then, with a stinted hand.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> corporal, who the night before
had resolved in his mind to supply the grand <i>desideratum</i>, of
keeping up something like an incessant firing upon the enemy during
the heat of the attack,—had no further idea in his fancy at that time, than a contrivance of smoking tobacco
against the town, out of one of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s six
field-pieces, which were planted on each side of his sentry-box;
the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy at the same
time, though he had pledged his cap, he thought it in no danger
from the miscarriage of his projects.</p>

<p>Upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he
soon began to find out, that by means of his two <i>Turkish</i>
tobacco-pipes, with the supplement of three smaller tubes of
wash-leather at each of their lower ends, to be tagg’d by the
same number of tin-pipes fitted to the touch-holes, and sealed with
clay next the cannon, and then tied hermetically with waxed silk at
their several insertions into the <i>Morocco</i> tube,—he
should be able to fire the six field-pieces all together, and with
the same ease as to fire one.———</p>

<p>——Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may
not be cut out for the advancement of human knowledge. Let no man, who
has read my father’s first and second <i>beds of justice</i>,
ever rise up and say again, from collision of what kinds of bodies
light may or may not be struck out, to carry the arts and sciences
up to perfection.——Heaven! thou knowest how I love
them;——thou knowest the secrets of my heart, and that I
would this moment give my shirt——Thou art a fool,
<i>Shandy</i>, says <i>Eugenius</i>, for thou hast but a dozen in
the world,—and ’twill break thy set.——</p>

<p>No matter for that, <i>Eugenius;</i> I would give the shirt off
my back to be burnt into tinder, were it only to satisfy one
feverish enquirer, how many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint
and steel could strike into the tail of it.——Think ye
not that in striking these <i>in</i>,—he might,
per-adventure, strike something <i>out?</i> as sure as a
gun.——</p>

<p>——But this project, by the bye.</p>

<p>The corporal sat up the best part of the night, in bringing
<i>his</i> to perfection; and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon,
with charging them to the top with tobacco,—he went with
contentment to bed.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> corporal had slipped out about
ten minutes before my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in order to fix his
apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle
<i>Toby</i> came.</p>

<p>He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up
together in front of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s sentry-box,
leaving only an interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the
three, on the right and left, for the convenience of charging,
&amp;c.—and the sake possibly of two batteries, which he
might think double the honour of one.</p>

<p>In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door
of the sentry-box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal
wisely taken his post:——He held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery on
the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his right
hand,—and the ebony pipe tipp’d with silver, which
appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the finger and
thumb of the other——and with his right knee fixed firm
upon the ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the
corporal, with his Montero-cap upon his head, furiously playing off
his two cross batteries at the same time against the counter-guard,
which faced the counterscarp, where the attack was to be made that
morning. His first intention, as I said, was no more than giving
the enemy a single puff or two;—but the pleasure of the
<i>puffs</i>, as well as the <i>puffing</i>, had insensibly got
hold of the corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the
very height of the attack, by the time my uncle <i>Toby</i> joined
him.</p>

<p>’Twas well for my father, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> had
not his will to make that day.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXI</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i> took the ivory
pipe out of the corporal’s hand,—looked at it for half
a minute, and returned it.</p>

<p>In less than two minutes, my uncle <i>Toby</i> took the pipe
from the corporal again, and raised it half way to his
mouth——then hastily gave it back a second time.</p>

<p>The corporal redoubled the attack,——my uncle
<i>Toby</i> smiled,——then looked
grave,——then smiled for a moment,——then
looked serious for a long time;——Give me hold of the
ivory pipe, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——my
uncle <i>Toby</i> put it to his lips,——drew it back
directly,——gave a peep over the horn-beam
hedge;——never did my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s mouth
water so much for a pipe in his life.——My uncle
<i>Toby</i> retired into the sentry-box with the pipe in his
hand.———</p>

<p>——Dear uncle <i>Toby</i>! don’t go into the
sentry-box with the pipe,—there’s no trusting a
man’s self with such a thing in such a corner.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>BEG</small> the reader will assist me here,
to wheel off my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s ordnance behind the
scenes,——to remove his sentry-box, and clear the
theatre, if possible, of horn-works and half moons, and get the
rest of his military apparatus out of the way;——that
done, my dear friend <i>Garrick</i>, we’ll snuff the candles
bright,—sweep the stage with a new broom,—draw up the
curtain, and exhibit my uncle <i>Toby</i> dressed in a new
character, throughout which the world can have no idea how he will
act: and yet, if pity be a-kin to love,—and bravery no alien
to it, you have seen enough of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in these, to
trace these family likenesses, betwixt the two passions (in case
there is one) to your heart’s content.</p>

<p>Vain science! thou assistest us in no case of this
kind—and thou puzzlest us in every one.</p>

<p>There was, Madam, in my uncle <i>Toby</i>, a singleness of heart
which misled him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in
which things of this nature usually go on; you can—you can
have no conception of it: with this, there was a plainness and
simplicity of thinking, with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the
plies and foldings of the heart of woman;——and so naked
and defenceless did he stand before you, (when a siege was out of
his head,) that you might have stood behind any one of your
serpentine walks, and shot my uncle <i>Toby</i> ten times in a day,
through his liver, if nine times in a day, Madam, had not served
your purpose.</p>

<p>With all this, Madam,—and what confounded every thing as
much on the other hand, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had that unparalleled
modesty of nature I once told you of, and which, by the bye, stood
eternal sentry upon his feelings, that you might as soon——But where am I going?
these reflections crowd in upon me ten pages at least too soon, and
take up that time, which I ought to bestow upon facts.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>O<small>F</small> the few legitimate sons of
<i>Adam</i> whose breasts never felt what the sting of love
was,—(maintaining first, all mysogynists to be
bastards,)—the greatest heroes of ancient and modern story
have carried off amongst them nine parts in ten of the honour; and
I wish for their sakes I had the key of my study, out of my
draw-well, only for five minutes, to tell you their
names—recollect them I cannot—so be content to accept
of these, for the present, in their stead.</p>

<p>There was the great king <i>Aldrovandus</i>, and
<i>Bosphorus</i>, and <i>Cappadocius</i>, and <i>Dardanus</i>, and
<i>Pontus</i>, and <i>Asius</i>,——to say nothing of the
iron-hearted <i>Charles</i> the XIIth, whom the Countess of
K***** herself could make nothing of.——There
was <i>Babylonicus</i>, and <i>Mediterraneus</i>, and
<i>Polixenes</i>, and <i>Persicus</i>, and <i>Prusicus</i>, not one
of whom (except <i>Cappadocius</i> and <i>Pontus</i>, who were both
a little suspected) ever once bowed down his breast to the
goddess——The truth is, they had all of them something
else to do—and so had my uncle <i>Toby</i>—till
Fate—till Fate I say, envying his name the glory of being
handed down to posterity with <i>Aldrovandus</i>’s and the
rest,—she basely patched up the peace of <i>Utrecht.</i></p>

<p>——Believe me, Sirs, ’twas the worst deed she
did that year.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>MONGST</small> the many ill consequences of
the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, it was within a point of giving my
uncle <i>Toby</i> a surfeit of sieges; and though he recovered his
appetite afterwards, yet <i>Calais</i> itself left not a deeper
scar in <i>Mary</i>’s heart, than <i>Utrecht</i> upon my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s. To the end of his life he never could hear <i>Utrecht</i> mentioned upon any
account whatever,—or so much as read an article of news
extracted out of the <i>Utrecht Gazette</i>, without fetching a
sigh, as if his heart would break in twain.</p>

<p>My father, who was a great <small>MOTIVE-MONGER</small>, and
consequently a very dangerous person for a man to sit by, either
laughing or crying,—for he generally knew your motive for
doing both, much better than you knew it yourself—would
always console my uncle <i>Toby</i> upon these occasions, in a way,
which shewed plainly, he imagined my uncle <i>Toby</i> grieved for
nothing in the whole affair, so much as the loss of his
<i>hobby-horse.</i>——Never mind, brother <i>Toby</i>,
he would say,—by God’s blessing we shall have another
war break out again some of these days; and when it does,—the
belligerent powers, if they would hang themselves, cannot keep us
out of play.——I defy ’em, my dear <i>Toby</i>, he
would add, to take countries without taking towns,——or
towns without sieges.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> never took this back-stroke of my
father’s at his hobby-horse kindly.——He thought
the stroke ungenerous; and the more so, because in striking the
horse he hit the rider too, and in the most dishonourable part a
blow could fall; so that upon these occasions, he always laid down
his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than
common.</p>

<p>I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was not eloquent; and in the very same page gave an
instance to the contrary:——I repeat the observation,
and a fact which contradicts it again.—He was not
eloquent,—it was not easy to my uncle <i>Toby</i> to make
long harangues,—and he hated florid ones; but there were
occasions where the stream overflowed the man, and ran so counter
to its usual course, that in some parts my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for a
time, was at least equal to <i>Tertullus</i>——but in
others, in my own opinion, infinitely above him.</p>

<p>My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical
orations of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s, which he had delivered
one evening before him and <i>Yorick</i>, that he wrote it down
before he went to bed.</p>

<p>I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my
father’s papers, with here and there an insertion of his own,
betwixt two crooks, thus [  ], and is endorsed,<br>
MY BROTHER TOBY’S JUSTIFICATION OF HIS OWN
PRINCIPLES AND CONDUCT IN WISHING TO CONTINUE THE WAR.
</p>

<p>I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s a hundred times, and think it so fine
a model of defence,—and shews so sweet a temperament of
gallantry and good principles in him, that I give it the world,
word for word (interlineations and all), as I find it.</p>

<h3>

&nbsp;LXXV</small><br>
<br>
MY &nbsp;UNCLE &nbsp;TOBY’S
&nbsp;APOLOGETICAL &nbsp;ORATION
</h3>

<p>I <small>AM</small> not insensible, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, that when a man whose profession is arms, wishes, as
I have done, for war,—it has an ill aspect to the
world;——and that, how just and right soever his motives
the intentions may be,—he stands in an uneasy posture in
vindicating himself from private views in doing it.</p>

<p>For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be
without being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter
his wish in the hearing of an enemy; for say what he will, an enemy
will not believe him.——He will be cautious of doing it
even to a friend,—lest he may suffer in his
esteem:——But if his heart is overcharged, and a secret
sigh for arms must have its vent, he will reserve it for the ear of
a brother, who knows his character to the bottom, and what his true
notions, dispositions, and principles of honour are: What, I <i>hope</i>, I
have been in all these, brother <i>Shandy</i>, would be unbecoming
in me to say:——much worse, I know, have I been than I
ought,—and something worse, perhaps, than I think: But such
as I am, you, my dear brother <i>Shandy</i>, who have sucked the
same breasts with me,—and with whom I have been brought up
from my cradle,—and from whose knowledge, from the first
hours of our boyish pastimes, down to this, I have concealed no one
action of my life, and scarce a thought in it——Such as
I am, brother, you must by this time know me, with all my vices,
and with all my weaknesses too, whether of my age, my temper, my
passions, or my understanding.</p>

<p>Tell me then, my dear brother <i>Shandy</i>, upon which of them
it is, that when I condemned the peace of <i>Utrecht</i>, and
grieved the war was not carried on with vigour a little longer, you
should think your brother did it upon unworthy views; or that in
wishing for war, he should be bad enough to wish more of his
fellow-creatures slain,—more slaves made, and more families
driven from their peaceful habitations, merely for his own
pleasure:——Tell me, brother <i>Shandy</i>, upon what
one deed of mine do you ground it? [<i>The devil a deed do I know
of, dear</i> Toby, <i>but one for a hundred pounds, which I lent
thee to carry on these cursed sieges.</i>]</p>

<p>If, when I was a school-boy, I could not hear a drum beat, but
my heart beat with it—was it my fault?——Did I
plant the propensity there?——Did I sound the alarm
within, or Nature?</p>

<p>When <i>Guy</i>, Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, and <i>Parismus</i> and
<i>Parismenus</i>, and <i>Valentine</i> and <i>Orson</i>, and the
<i>Seven Champions of England</i>, were handed around the
school,—were they not all purchased with my own pocket-money?
Was that selfish, brother <i>Shandy</i>? When we read over the
siege of <i>Troy</i>, which lasted ten years and eight
months,——though with such a train of artillery as we
had at <i>Namur</i>, the town might have been carried in a week—was I not as much concerned for the
destruction of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Trojans</i> as any boy of
the whole school? Had I not three strokes of a ferula given me, two
on my right hand, and one on my left, for calling <i>Helena</i> a
bitch for it? Did any one of you shed more tears for <i>Hector?</i>
And when king <i>Priam</i> came to the camp to beg his body, and
returned weeping back to <i>Troy</i> without it,—you know,
brother, I could not eat my dinner.——</p>

<p>——Did that bespeak me cruel? Or because, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, my blood flew out into the camp, and my heart panted
for war,—was it a proof it could not ache for the distresses
of war too?</p>

<p>O brother! ’tis one thing for a soldier to gather
laurels,—and ’tis another to scatter
cypress.——[<i>Who told thee, my dear Toby, that cypress
was used by the antients on mournful occasions?</i>&nbsp;]</p>

<p>——’Tis one thing, brother <i>Shandy</i>, for a
soldier to hazard his own life—to leap first down into the
trench, where he is sure to be cut in
pieces:——’Tis one thing, from public spirit and a thirst of glory, to
enter the breach the first man,—to stand in the foremost
rank, and march bravely on with drums and trumpets, and colours
flying about his ears:——’Tis one thing, I say,
brother <i>Shandy</i>, to do this,—and ’tis another
thing to reflect on the miseries of war;—to view the
desolations of whole countries, and consider the intolerable
fatigues and hardships which the soldier himself, the instrument
who works them, is forced (for sixpence a day, if he can get it) to
undergo.</p>

<p>Need I be told, dear <i>Yorick</i>, as I was by you, in <i>Le
Fever</i>’s funeral sermon, <i>That so soft and gentle a
creature, born to love, to mercy, and kindness, as man is, was not
shaped for this?</i>——But why did you not add,
<i>Yorick</i>,—if not by <small>NATURE</small>—that he
is so by <small>NECESSITY</small>?——For what is war?
what is it, <i>Yorick</i>, when fought as ours has been, upon
principles of <i>liberty</i>, and upon principles of
<i>honour</i>—what is it, but the getting together of quiet
and harmless people, with their swords in their hands, to keep the
ambitious and the turbulent within bounds? And heaven is my
witness, brother <i>Shandy</i>, that the pleasure I have taken in
these things,—and that infinite delight, in particular, which
has attended my sieges in my bowling-green, has arose within me,
and I hope in the corporal too, from the consciousness we both had,
that in carrying them on, we were answering the great ends of our
creation.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>I <small>TOLD</small> the Christian reader—I
say <i>Christian</i>——hoping he is one——and
if he is not, I am sorry for it——and only beg he will
consider the matter with himself, and not lay the blame entirely
upon this book——</p>

<p>I told him, Sir——for in good truth, when a man is
telling a story in the strange way I do mine, he is obliged
continually to be going backwards and forwards to keep all tight
together in the reader’s fancy——which, for my own
part, if I did not take heed to do more than at first, there is so
much unfixed and equivocal matter starting up, with so many breaks
and gaps in it,—and so little service do the stars afford,
which, nevertheless, I hang up in some of the darkest passages,
knowing that the world is apt to lose its way, with all the lights
the sun itself at noon-day can give it——and now you
see, I am lost myself!——</p>

<p>——But ’tis my father’s fault; and
whenever my brains come to be dissected, you will perceive, without
spectacles, that he has left a large uneven thread, as you
sometimes see in an unsaleable piece of cambrick, running along the
whole length of the web, and so untowardly, you cannot so much as
cut out a * *, (here I hang up a couple of lights
again)——or a fillet, or a thumb-stall, but it is seen
or felt.——</p>

<p><i>Quanto id diligentias in liberis procreandis cavendum</i>,
sayeth <i>Cardan.</i> All which being considered, and that you see
’tis morally impracticable for me to wind this round to
where I set out——</p>

<p>I begin the chapter over again.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>TOLD</small> the Christian reader in the
beginning of the chapter which preceded my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s apologetical oration,—though in a
different trope from what I should make use of now, That the peace
of <i>Utrecht</i> was within an ace of creating the same shyness
betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and his hobby-horse, as it did betwixt
the queen and the rest of the confederating powers.</p>

<p>There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his
horse, which, as good as says to him, “I’ll go
afoot, Sir, all the days of my life before I would ride a single
mile upon your back again.” Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> could
not be said to dismount his horse in this manner; for in strictness
of language, he could not be said to dismount his horse at
all——his horse rather flung him——and somewhat
<i>viciously</i>, which made my uncle <i>Toby</i> take it ten times
more unkindly. Let this matter be settled by state-jockies as they
like.——It created, I say, a sort of shyness betwixt my
uncle <i>Toby</i> and his hobby-horse.——He had no
occasion for him from the month of <i>March</i> to <i>November</i>,
which was the summer after the articles were signed, except it was
now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that the
fortifications and harbour of <i>Dunkirk</i> were demolished,
according to stipulation.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> were so backwards all that summer in setting
about that affair, and Monsieur <i>Tugghe</i>, the deputy from the
magistrates of <i>Dunkirk</i>, presented so many affecting
petitions to the queen,—beseeching her majesty to cause only
her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works, which might have
incurred her displeasure,—but to spare—to spare the
mole, for the mole’s sake; which, in its naked situation,
could be no more than an object of pity——and the queen
(who was but a woman) being of a pitiful
disposition,—and her ministers also, they not wishing in
their hearts to have the town dismantled, for these private
reasons, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *——</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ; so that the
whole went heavily on with my uncle <i>Toby;</i> insomuch, that it
was not within three full months, after he and the corporal had
constructed the town, and put it in a condition to be destroyed,
that the several commandants, commissaries, deputies, negociators,
and intendants, would permit him to set about
it.——Fatal interval of inactivity!</p>

<p>The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a
breach in the ramparts, or main fortifications of the
town——No,—that will never do, corporal, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, for in going that way to work with the town, the
<i>English</i> garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if
the French are treacherous——They are as treacherous as devils,
an’ please your honour, said the corporal——It
gives me concern always when I hear it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby;</i>—for they don’t want personal bravery; and
if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may enter it, and make
themselves masters of the place when they please:—Let them
enter it, said the corporal, lifting up his pioneer’s spade
in both his hands, as if he was going to lay about him with
it,—let them enter, an’ please your honour, if they
dare.——In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, slipping his right hand down to the middle of his
cane, and holding it afterwards truncheon-wise with his fore-finger
extended,——’tis no part of the consideration of a
commandant, what the enemy dare,—or what they dare not do; he
must act with prudence. We will begin with the outworks both
towards the sea and the land, and particularly with fort
<i>Louis</i>, the most distant of them all, and demolish it
first,—and the rest, one by one, both on our right and left, as we retreat towards
the town;——then we’ll demolish the
mole,—next fill up the harbour,—then retire into the
citadel, and blow it up into the air: and having done that,
corporal, we’ll embark for <i>England.</i>——We
are there, quoth the corporal, recollecting
himself——Very true, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—looking at the church.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>A <small>DELUSIVE</small>, delicious consultation or
two of this kind, betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i>,
upon the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>,—for a moment rallied
back the ideas of those pleasures, which were slipping from under
him:——still—still all went on
heavily——the magic left the mind the
weaker—S<small>TILLNESS</small>, with S<small>ILENCE</small>
at her back, entered the solitary parlour, and drew their gauzy
mantle over my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head;—and
L<small>ISTLESSNESS</small>, with her lax fibre and undirected eye,
sat quietly down beside him in his arm-chair.——No longer
<i>Amberg</i> and <i>Rhinberg</i>, and <i>Limbourg</i>, and
<i>Huy</i>, and <i>Bonn</i>, in one year,—and the prospect of
<i>Landen</i>, and <i>Trerebach</i>, and <i>Drusen</i>, and
<i>Dendermond</i>, the next,—hurried on the blood:—No
longer did saps, and mines, and blinds, and gabions, and
palisadoes, keep out this fair enemy of man’s
repose:——No more could my uncle <i>Toby</i>, after
passing the <i>French</i> lines, as he eat his egg at supper, from
thence break into the heart of <i>France</i>,—cross over the
<i>Oyes</i>, and with all <i>Picardie</i> open behind him, march up
to the gates of <i>Paris</i>, and fall asleep with nothing but
ideas of glory:——No more was he to dream, he had fixed
the royal standard upon the tower of the <i>Bastile</i>, and awake
with it streaming in his head.</p>

<p>——Softer visions,—gentler vibrations stole
sweetly in upon his slumbers;—the trumpet of war fell out of
his hands,—he took up the lute, sweet instrument! of all
others the most delicate! the most difficult!——how wilt
thou touch it, my dear uncle <i>Toby</i>?</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small>, because I have once or twice
said, in my inconsiderate way of talking, That I was confident the
following memoirs of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s courtship of
widow <i>Wadman</i>, whenever I got time to write them, would turn
out one of the most complete systems, both of the elementary and
practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to
the world——are you to imagine from thence, that I shall
set out with a description of <i>what love is?</i> whether part God
and part Devil, as <i>Plotinus</i> will have it——</p>

<p>——Or by a more critical equation, and supposing the
whole of love to be as ten——to determine with
<i>Ficinus</i>, “<i>How many parts of it—the
one,—and how many the other;</i>”—or whether it
is <i>all of it one great Devil</i>, from head to tail, as
<i>Plato</i> has taken upon him to pronounce; concerning which
conceit of his, I shall not offer my opinion:—but my opinion of <i>Plato</i> is this; that
he appears, from this instance, to have been a man of much the same
temper and way of reasoning with doctor <i>Baynyard</i>, who being
a great enemy to blisters, as imagining that half a dozen of
’em at once, would draw a man as surely to his grave, as a
herse and six—rashly concluded, that the Devil himself was
nothing in the world, but one great bouncing
<i>Cantharidis.</i>——</p>

<p>I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this
monstrous liberty in arguing, but what <i>Nazianzen</i> cried out
(<i>that is, polemically</i>) to
<i>Philagrius</i>——</p>

<p>
“’Ευγε!”
<i>O rare! ’tis fine reasoning, Sir
indeed!</i>—“οτι
φιλοσοφεισ
ευ Παθεσ.”
<i>and most nobly do you aim at truth, when you philosophize about
it in your moods and passions.</i></p>

<p>Nor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to
inquire, whether love is a disease,——or embroil myself
with <i>Rhasis</i> and <i>Dioscorides</i>, whether the seat of it
is in the brain or liver;—because this would lead me on, to
an examination of the two very opposite manners, in
which patients have been treated——the one, of
<i>Aœtius</i>, who always begun with a cooling clyster of
hempseed and bruised cucumbers;—and followed on with thin
potations of water-lilies and purslane—to which he added a
pinch of snuff, of the herb <i>Hanea;</i>—and where
<i>Aœtius</i> durst venture it,—his topaz-ring.</p>

<p>——The other, that of <i>Gordonius</i>, who (in his
cap. 15. <i>de Amore</i>) directs they should be thrashed,
“<i>ad putorem usque</i>,”——till they stink
again.</p>

<p>These are disquisitions which my father, who had laid in a great
stock of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with in the
progress of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s affairs: I must anticipate
thus much, That from his theories of love, (with which, by the way,
he contrived to crucify my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s mind, almost
as much as his amours themselves,)—he took a single step into
practice;—and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he
found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was making my
uncle <i>Toby</i> a new pair of breeches, he produced
<i>Gordonius</i>’s effect upon my uncle <i>Toby</i> without
the disgrace.</p>

<p>What changes this produced, will be read in its proper place:
all that is needful to be added to the anecdote, is
this——That whatever effect it had upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,——it had a vile effect upon the
house;——and if my uncle <i>Toby</i> had not smoaked it
down as he did, it might have had a vile effect upon my father
too.</p>

<p>——’T<small>WILL</small> come out
of itself by and bye.——All I contend for is, that I am
not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is; and so
long as I can go on with my story intelligibly, with the help of
the word itself, without any other idea to it, than what I have in
common with the rest of the world, why should I differ from it
a moment before the time?——When I can get
on no further,—and find myself entangled on all sides of this
mystic labyrinth,—my Opinion will then come in, in
course,—and lead me out.</p>

<p>At present, I hope I shall be sufficiently understood, in
telling the reader, my uncle <i>Toby fell in love:</i></p>

<p>—Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a
man is <i>fallen</i> in love,—or that he is <i>deeply</i> in
love,—or up to the ears in love,—and sometimes even
<i>over head and ears in it</i>,—carries an idiomatical kind
of implication, that love is a thing <i>below</i> a man:—this
is recurring again to <i>Plato</i>’s opinion, which, with all
his divinityship,—I hold to be damnable and
heretical:—and so much for that.</p>

<p>Let love therefore be what it will,—my uncle <i>Toby</i>
fell into it.</p>

<p>——And possibly, gentle reader, with such a
temptation—so wouldst thou: For never did thy eyes behold, or
thy concupiscence covet any thing in this world, more concupiscible than widow
<i>Wadman.</i></p>

<p>A<small>S</small> <i>Susannah</i> was informed by an
express from Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it
happened,—the contents of which express, <i>Susannah</i>
communicated to my mother the next day,—it has just given me
an opportunity of entering upon my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s amours
a fortnight before their existence.</p>

<p>I have an article of news to tell you, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, quoth
my mother, which will surprise you greatly.——</p>

<p>Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of
justice, and was musing within himself about the hardships of
matrimony, as my mother broke silence.——</p>

<p>“—My brother <i>Toby</i>, quoth she, is going to be
married to Mrs. <i>Wadman.</i>”</p>

<p>——Then he will never, quoth my father, be able to
lie diagonally in his bed again as long as he lives.</p>

<p>It was a consuming vexation to my father, that my mother never
asked the meaning of a thing she did not understand.</p>

<p>——That she is not a woman of science, my father
would say—is her misfortune—but she might ask a
question.—</p>

<p>My mother never did.——In short, she went out of the
world at last without knowing whether it turned <i>round</i>, or
stood <i>still.</i>——My father had officiously told her
above a thousand times which way it was,—but she always
forgot.</p>

<p>For these reasons, a discourse seldom went on much further
betwixt them, than a proposition,—a reply, and a rejoinder;
at the end of which, it generally took breath for a few minutes (as
in the affair of the breeches), and then went on again.</p>

<p>If he marries, ’twill be the worse for us,—quoth my
mother.</p>

<p>Not a cherry-stone, said my father,—he may as well batter
away his means upon that, as any thing else,</p>

<p>——To be sure, said my mother: so here ended the
proposition—the reply,—and the rejoinder, I told you
of.</p>

<p>It will be some amusement to him, too,——said my
father.</p>

<p>A very great one, answered my mother, if he should have
children.——</p>

himself——* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<p>I <small>AM</small> now beginning to get fairly into
my work; and by the help of a vegetable diet, with a few of the
cold seeds, I make no doubt but I shall be able to go on with my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s story, and my own, in a tolerable
straight line. Now,
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img src="tristram_shandy_files/image07.jpg" alt="four very squiggly lines across the page signed Inv.T.S and Scw.T.S" width="300" height="241">

<p>
These were the four lines I moved in through my first, second, third, and
fourth volumes<a href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>——In the fifth volume I have
been very good,——the precise line I have described in it being
this:
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img src="tristram_shandy_files/image08.jpg" alt="One very squiggly line across the page with loops marked A,B,C,C,C,C,C,D." width="300" height="93">
</div>

<p>By which it appears, that except at the curve,
marked A. where I took a trip to <i>Navarre</i>,—and the
indented curve B. which is the short airing when I was there with
the Lady <i>Baussiere</i> and her page,—I have not taken the
least frisk of a digression, till <i>John de la Casse</i>’s
devils led me the round you see marked D.—for as for <i>c c c
c c</i> they are nothing but parentheses, and the common ins and
outs incident to the lives of the greatest ministers of state; and
when compared with what men have done,—or with my own
transgressions at the letters A&nbsp;B&nbsp;D—they vanish
into nothing.</p>

<p>In this last volume I have done better still—for from the
end of Le Fever’s episode, to the beginning of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s campaigns,—I have scarce stepped a yard
out of my way.</p>

<p>If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible——by the
good leave of his grace of <i>Benevento</i>’s
devils——but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency of
going on even thus:</p>

<hr>

<p>which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw
it, by a writing-master’s ruler (borrowed for that purpose),
turning neither to the right hand or to the left.</p>

walk in! say divines——</p>

<p>——The emblem of moral rectitude! says

<p>——<i>The best line!</i> say cabbage
planters——is the shortest line, says <i>Archimedes</i>,
which can be drawn from one given point to
another.——</p>

<p>I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart, in your
next birth- day suits!</p>

<p>——What a journey!</p>

<p>Pray can you tell me,—that is, without anger, before I
write my chapter upon straight lines——by what
mistake——who told them so——or how it has
come to pass, that your men of wit and genius have all along
confounded this line, with the line of

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>O</small>——I think, I said, I
would write two volumes every year, provided the vile cough which
then tormented me, and which to this hour I dread worse than the
devil, would but give me leave—and in another
place—(but where, I can’t recollect now) speaking of my
book as a <i>machine</i>, and laying my pen and ruler down
cross-wise upon the table, in order to gain the greater credit to
it—I swore it should be kept a going at that rate these forty
years, if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so long
with health and good spirits.</p>

<p>Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their
charge—nay so very little (unless the mounting me upon a long
stick and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the
twenty-four, be accusations) that on the contrary, I have
much—much to thank ’em for: cheerily have ye made me
tread the path of life with all the burthens of it (except its
cares) upon my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I
remember, have ye once deserted me, or tinged the objects which
came in my way, either with sable, or with a sickly green; in
dangers ye gilded my horizon with hope, and when
D<small>EATH</small> himself knocked at my door—ye bad him
come again; and in so gay a tone of careless indifference, did ye
do it, that he doubted of his commission——</p>

<p>“—There must certainly be some mistake in this
matter,” quoth he.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be
interrupted in a story——and I was that moment telling
<i>Eugenius</i> a most tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied
herself a shell-fish, and of a monk damn’d for eating a
muscle, and was shewing him the grounds and justice of the
procedure——</p>

<p>“—Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a
scrape?” quoth Death. Thou hast had a narrow escape,
<i>Tristram</i>, said <i>Eugenius</i>, taking hold of my hand as I
finished my story——</p>

<p>But there is no living, <i>Eugenius</i>, replied I, at this
rate; for as this <i>son of a whore</i> has found out my
lodgings——</p>

<p>—You call him rightly, said <i>Eugenius</i>,—for by
sin, we are told, he enter’d the world——I care
not which way he enter’d, quoth I, provided he be not in such
a hurry to take me out with him—for I have forty volumes to
write, and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the
world will say and do for me, except thyself; and as thou seest he
has got me by the throat (for <i>Eugenius</i> could scarce hear me
speak across the table), and that I am no match for him in the open
field, had I not better, whilst these few scatter’d spirits
remain, and these two spider legs of mine (holding one of
them up to him) are able to support me—had I not better,
<i>Eugenius</i>, fly for my life? ’Tis my advice, my dear
<i>Tristram</i>, said <i>Eugenius</i>—Then by heaven! I will
lead him a dance he little thinks of——for I will
gallop, quoth I, without looking once behind me, to the banks of
the <i>Garonne;</i> and if I hear him clattering at my
heels——I’ll scamper away to mount
<i>Vesuvius</i>——from thence to <i>Joppa</i>, and from
<i>Joppa</i> to the world’s end; where, if he follows me, I
pray God he may break his neck——</p>

<p>—He runs more risk <i>there</i>, said <i>Eugenius</i>,
than thou.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius</i>’s wit and affection brought blood into the
cheek from whence it had been some months
banish’d——’twas a vile moment to bid adieu
in; he led me to my chaise——<i>Allons!</i> said I; the
post-boy gave a crack with his whip——off I went like a
cannon, and in half a dozen bounds got into <i>Dover.</i></p>

<p>N<small>OW</small> hang it! quoth I, as I
look’d towards the <i>French</i> coast—a man should
know something of his own country too, before he goes
abroad——and I never gave a peep into <i>Rochester</i>
church, or took notice of the dock of <i>Chatham</i>, or visited
St. <i>Thomas</i> at <i>Canterbury</i>, though they all three laid
in my way——</p>

<p>—But mine, indeed, is a particular case——</p>

<p>So without arguing the matter further with <i>Thomas

boat, and in five minutes we got under sail, and scudded away like
the wind.</p>

<p>Pray, captain, quoth I, as I was going down into the cabin, is a
man never overtaken by <i>Death</i> in this passage?</p>

<p>Why, there is not time for a man to be sick in it, replied
he——What a cursed lyar! for I am sick as a horse, quoth
I, already——what a brain!——upside down!——hey-day! the cells are broke
loose one into another, and the blood, and the lymph, and the
nervous juices, with the fix’d and volatile salts, are all
jumbled into one mass——good G—! every thing turns
round in it like a thousand whirlpools——I’d give
a shilling to know if I shan’t write the clearer for
it——</p>

<p>Sick! sick! sick! sick!——</p>

<p>—When shall we get to land? captain—they have hearts
like stones——O I am deadly sick!——reach me
that thing, boy——’tis the most discomfiting
sickness——I wish I was at the bottom—Madam! how
is it with you? Undone! undone! un——O! undone!
sir——What the first time?——No, ’tis

sir,——hey-day!—what a trampling over
head!—hollo! cabin boy! what’s the matter?</p>

<p>The wind chopp’d about! s’Death—then I shall
meet him full in the face.</p>

<p>I<small>T</small> is a great inconvenience to a man
in a haste, that there are three distinct roads between
<i>Calais</i> and <i>Paris</i>, in behalf of which there is so much
to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along
them, that half a day is easily lost in settling which you’ll
take.</p>

<p>First, the road by <i>Lisle</i> and <i>Arras</i>, which is the
most about——but most interesting, and instructing.</p>

<p>The second, that by <i>Amiens</i>, which you may go, if you
would see <i>Chantilly</i>——</p>

<p>And that by <i>Beauvais</i>, which you may go, if you will.</p>

<p>For this reason a great many chuse to go by <i>Beauvais.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>“N<small>OW</small> before I quit
<i>Calais</i>,” a travel-writer would say, “it would
not be amiss to give some account of “it.”—Now I think it very
much amiss—that a man cannot go quietly through a town and
let it alone, when it does not meddle with him, but that he must be
turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses over,
merely o’ my conscience for the sake of drawing it; because,
if we may judge from what has been wrote of these things, by all
who have <i>wrote and gallop’d</i>—or who have
<i>gallop’d and wrote</i>, which is a different way still; or
who, for more expedition than the rest, have <i>wrote
galloping</i>, which is the way I do at present——from
the great <i>Addison</i>, who did it with his satchel of school
books hanging at his a—, and galling his beast’s
crupper at every stroke—there is not a gallopper of us all
who might not have gone on ambling quietly in his own ground (in
case he had any), and have wrote all he had to write, dry-shod, as
well as not.</p>

<p>For my own part, as heaven is my judge, and to which I shall
ever make my last appeal—I know no more of <i>Calais</i>
(except the little my barber told me of it as he was whetting his razor) than I do
this moment of <i>Grand Cairo</i>; for it was dusky in the evening
when I landed, and dark as pitch in the morning when I set out, and
yet by merely knowing what is what, and by drawing this from that
in one part of the town, and by spelling and putting this and that
together in another—I would lay any travelling odds, that I
this moment write a chapter upon <i>Calais</i> as long as my arm;
and with so distinct and satisfactory a detail of every item, which
is worth a stranger’s curiosity in the town—that you
would take me for the town-clerk of <i>Calais</i> itself—and
where, sir, would be the wonder? was not <i>Democritus</i>, who
laughed ten times more than I—town-clerk of <i>Abdera?</i>
and was not (I forget his name) who had more discretion than us
both, town-clerk of <i>Ephesus?</i>——it should be
penn’d moreover, sir, with so much knowledge and good sense,
and truth, and precision——</p>

<p>—Nay—if you don’t believe me, you may read the
chapter for your pains.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>C<small>ALAIS</small>, <i>Calatium, Calusium,
Calesium.</i></p>

<p>This town, if we may trust its archives, the authority of which
I see no reason to call in question in this place—was
<i>once</i> no more than a small village belonging to one of the
first Counts de <i>Guignes;</i> and as it boasts at present of no
less than fourteen thousand inhabitants, exclusive of four hundred
and twenty distinct families in the <i>basse ville</i>, or
suburbs——it must have grown up by little and little, I
suppose, to its present size.</p>

<p>Though there are four convents, there is but one parochial
church in the whole town; I had not an opportunity of taking its
exact dimensions, but it is pretty easy to make a tolerable
conjecture of ’em—for as there are fourteen thousand
inhabitants in the town, if the church holds them all it must be
considerably large—and if it will not—’tis a very
great pity they have not another—it is built in form of a cross, and dedicated to the Virgin <i>Mary;</i>
the steeple, which has a spire to it, is placed in the middle of
the church, and stands upon four pillars elegant and light enough,
but sufficiently strong at the same time—it is decorated with
eleven altars, most of which are rather fine than beautiful. The
great altar is a master- piece in its kind; ’tis of white
marble, and, as I was told, near sixty feet high—had it been
much higher, it had been as high as mount <i>Calvary</i>
itself—therefore, I suppose it must be high enough in all
conscience.</p>

<p>There was nothing struck me more than the great <i>Square;</i>
tho’ I cannot say ’tis either well paved or well built;
but ’tis in the heart of the town, and most of the streets,
especially those in that quarter, all terminate in it; could there
have been a fountain in all <i>Calais</i>, which it seems there
cannot, as such an object would have been a great ornament, it is
not to be doubted, but that the inhabitants would have had it in
the very centre of this square,—not that it is properly a
square,—because ’tis forty feet longer from
east to west, than from north to south; so that the <i>French</i>
in general have more reason on their side in calling them
<i>Places</i> than <i>Squares</i>, which, strictly speaking, to be
sure, they are not.</p>

<p>The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be
kept in the best repair; otherwise it had been a second great
ornament to this place; it answers however its destination, and
serves very well for the reception of the magistrates, who assemble
in it from time to time; so that ’tis presumable, justice is
regularly distributed.</p>

<p>I have heard much of it, but there is nothing at all curious in
the <i>Courgain;</i> ’tis a distinct quarter of the town,
inhabited solely by sailors and fishermen; it consists of a number
of small streets, neatly built and mostly of brick; ’tis
extremely populous, but as that may be accounted for, from the
principles of their diet,—there is nothing curious in that
neither.——A traveller may see it to satisfy
himself—he must not omit however taking notice of <i>La Tour de Guet</i>, upon
any account; ’tis so called from its particular destination,
because in war it serves to discover and give notice of the enemies
which approach the place, either by sea or land;——but
’tis monstrous high, and catches the eye so continually, you
cannot avoid taking notice of it if you would.</p>

<p>It was a singular disappointment to me, that I could not have
permission to take an exact survey of the fortifications, which are
the strongest in the world, and which, from first to last, that is,
for the time they were set about by <i>Philip</i> of <i>France</i>,
Count of <i>Bologne</i>, to the present war, wherein many
reparations were made, have cost (as I learned afterwards from an
engineer in <i>Gascony</i>)—above a hundred millions of
livres. It is very remarkable, that at the <i>Tête de
Gravelenes</i>, and where the town is naturally the weakest, they
have expended the most money; so that the outworks stretch a great
way into the campaign, and consequently occupy a large tract of
ground—However, after all that is <i>said</i> and
<i>done</i>, it must be acknowledged that <i>Calais</i> was never
upon any account so considerable from itself, as from its
situation, and that easy entrance which it gave our ancestors, upon
all occasions, into <i>France:</i> it was not without its
inconveniences also; being no less troublesome to the
<i>English</i> in those times, than <i>Dunkirk</i> has been to us,
in ours; so that it was deservedly looked upon as the key to both
kingdoms, which no doubt is the reason that there have arisen so
many contentions who should keep it: of these, the siege of
<i>Calais</i>, or rather the blockade (for it was shut up both by
land and sea), was the most memorable, as it with-stood the efforts
of <i>Edward</i> the Third a whole year, and was not terminated at
last but by famine and extreme misery; the gallantry of <i>Eustace
de St. Pierre</i>, who first offered himself a victim for his
fellow-citizens, has rank’d his name with heroes. As it will
not take up above fifty pages, it would be injustice to the reader,
not to give him a minute account of that romantic transaction, as well
as of the siege itself, in <i>Rapin</i>’s own words:</p>

warms the visionary brain, and lights the spirits through unworldly
tracts! ere I would force a helpless creature upon this hard
service, and make thee pay, poor soul! for fifty pages, which I
have no right to sell thee,——naked as I am, I would

the vehicle he rides in—woe be to truth! and woe be to the
vehicle and its tackling (let ’em be made of what stuff you
will) upon which he breathes forth the disappointment of his
soul!</p>

<p>As I never give general characters either of men or things in
choler, “<i>the most haste the worse speed</i>,” was
all the reflection I made upon the affair, the first time it
happen’d;—the second, third, fourth, and fifth time, I
confined it respectively to those times, and accordingly blamed
only the second, third, fourth, and fifth post-boy for it, without
carrying my reflections further; but the event
continuing to befal me from the fifth, to the sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth time, and without one exception, I then
could not avoid making a national reflection of it, which I do in
these words;</p>

<p><i>That something is always wrong in a French post-chaise, upon
first setting out.</i></p>

<p>Or the proposition may stand thus:</p>

<p><i>A French postilion has always to alight before he has got
three hundred yards out of town.</i></p>

<p>What’s wrong now?——Diable!——a
rope’s broke!——a knot has slipt!——a
staple’s drawn!——a bolt’s to
whittle!——a tag, a rag, a jag, a strap, a buckle, or a
buckle’s tongue, want altering.</p>

<p>Now true as all this is, I never think myself impowered to
excommunicate thereupon either the post-chaise, or its
driver——nor do I take it into my head to swear by the
living G—, I would rather go a-foot ten thousand
times——or that I will be damn’d, if ever I get
into another——but I take the matter coolly
before me, and consider, that some tag, or rag, or jag, or bolt, or
buckle, or buckle’s tongue, will ever be a wanting or want
altering, travel where I will—so I never chaff, but take the
good and the bad as they fall in my road, and get
on:——Do so, my lad! said I; he had lost five minutes
already, in alighting in order to get at a luncheon of black bread,
which he had cramm’d into the chaise-pocket, and was
remounted, and going leisurely on, to relish it the
better.——Get on, my lad, said I, briskly—but in
the most persuasive tone imaginable, for I jingled a
four-and-twenty sous piece against the glass, taking care to hold
the flat side towards him, as he look’d back: the dog
grinn’d intelligence from his right ear to his left, and
behind his sooty muzzle discovered such a pearly row of teeth, that
<i>Sovereignty</i> would have pawn’d her jewels for
them.<br>
Just heaven! {What masticators!—/What bread!—</p>

<p>and so as he finished the last mouthful of it, we
entered the town of <i>Montreuil.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> is not a town in all
<i>France</i> which, in my opinion, looks better in the map, than
M<small>ONTREUIL</small>;——I own, it does not look so
well in the book of post-roads; but when you come to see
it—to be sure it looks most pitifully.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, in it at present very handsome; and
that is, the inn-keeper’s daughter: She has been eighteen
months at <i>Amiens</i>, and six at <i>Paris</i>, in going through
her classes; so knits, and sews, and dances, and does the little
coquetries very well.——</p>

<p>—A slut! in running them over within these five minutes
that I have stood looking at her, she has let fall at least a dozen
loops in a white thread stocking——yes, yes—I see,
you cunning gipsy!—’tis long and taper—you need
not pin it to your knee—and that ’tis your
own—and fits you exactly.——</p>

<p>——That Nature should have told this creature a word
about a <i>statue’s thumb!</i></p>

<p>—But as this sample is worth all their
thumbs—besides, I have her thumbs and fingers in at the
bargain, if they can be any guide to me,—and as
<i>Janatone</i> withal (for that is her name) stands so well for a
drawing——may I never draw more, or rather may I draw
like a draught-horse, by main strength all the days of my
life,—if I do not draw her in all her proportions, and with
as determined a pencil, as if I had her in the wettest
drapery.——</p>

<p>—But your worships chuse rather that I give you the
length, breadth, and perpendicular height of the great
parish-church, or drawing of the façade of the abbey of
Saint <i>Austreberte</i> which has been transported from
<i>Artois</i> hither—every thing is just I suppose as the
masons and carpenters left them,—and if the belief in <i>Christ</i> continues so long, will be
so these fifty years to come—so your worships and reverences
may all measure them at your leisures——but he who
measures thee, <i>Janatone</i>, must do it now—thou carriest
the principles of change within thy frame; and considering the
chances of a transitory life, I would not answer for thee a moment;
ere twice twelve months are passed and gone, thou mayest grow out
like a pumpkin, and lose thy shapes——or thou mayest go
off like a flower, and lose thy beauty—nay, thou mayest go
off like a hussy—and lose thyself.—I would not answer
for my aunt <i>Dinah</i>, was she alive——’faith,
scarce for her picture——were it but painted by
<i>Reynolds</i>—</p>

<p>But if I go on with my drawing, after naming that son of
<i>Apollo</i>, I’ll be shot——</p>

<p>So you must e’en be content with the original; which, if
the evening is fine in passing thro’ <i>Montreuil</i>, you
will see at your chaise-door, as you change horses: but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I
have—you had better stop:—She has a little of the
<i>devote:</i> but that, sir, is a terce to a nine in your
favour——</p>

<p>—L— help me! I could not count a single point: so
had been piqued and repiqued, and capotted to the devil.</p>

<p>A<small>LL</small> which being considered, and that
Death moreover might be much nearer me than I
imagined——I wish I was at <i>Abbeville</i>, quoth I,
were it only to see how they card and spin——so off we

</h3>

<p>W<small>HAT</small> a vast advantage is travelling!
only it heats one; but there is a remedy for that, which you may
pick out of the next chapter.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>AS</small> I in a condition to stipulate
with Death, as I am this moment with my apothecary, how and where I
will take his clyster——I should certainly declare
against submitting to it before my friends; and therefore I never
seriously think upon the mode and manner of this great catastrophe,
which generally takes up and torments my thoughts as much as the
catastrophe itself; but I constantly draw the curtain across it
with this wish, that the Disposer of all things may so order it,
that it happen not to me in my own house——but rather in
some decent inn——at home, I know it,——the
concern of my friends, and the last services of wiping my brows, and smoothing my pillow, which
the quivering hand of pale affection shall pay me, will so crucify
my soul, that I shall die of a distemper which my physician is not
aware of: but in an inn, the few cold offices I wanted, would be
purchased with a few guineas, and paid me with an undisturbed, but
punctual attention——but mark. This inn should not be
the inn at <i>Abbeville</i>——if there was not another
inn in the universe, I would strike that inn out of the
capitulation: so</p>

<p>Let the horses be in the chaise exactly by four in the
morning——Yes, by four, Sir,——or by
<i>Genevieve!</i> I’ll raise a clatter in the house shall
wake the dead.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCVI</small>
</h3>

<p>“M<small>AKE</small> <i>them like unto a
wheel</i>,” is a bitter sarcasm, as all the learned know,
against the <i>grand tour</i>, and that restless spirit for making
it, which <i>David</i> prophetically foresaw would haunt the
children of men in the latter days; and therefore, as thinketh the great bishop
<i>Hall</i>, ’tis one of the severest imprecations which
<i>David</i> ever utter’d against the enemies of the
Lord—and, as if he had said, “I wish them no
worse luck than always to be rolling about.”—So much
motion, continues he (for he was very corpulent)—is so much
unquietness; and so much of rest, by the same analogy, is so much
of heaven.</p>

<p>Now, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of
motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy——and
that to stand still, or get on but slowly, is death and the
devil——</p>

<p>Hollo! Ho!——the whole world’s
asleep!——bring out the horses——grease the
wheels——tie on the mail——and drive a nail
into that moulding——I’ll not lose a
moment——</p>

<p>Now the wheel we are talking of, and <i>whereinto</i> (but not
<i>whereonto</i>, for that would make an Ixion’s wheel of it)
he curseth his enemies, according to the bishop’s habit of
body, should certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether they were set up in
<i>Palestine</i> at that time or not——and my wheel, for
the contrary reasons, must as certainly be a cart-wheel groaning
round its revolution once in an age; and of which sort, were I to
turn commentator, I should make no scruple to affirm, they had
great store in that hilly country.</p>

<p>I love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear
<i>Jenny</i>) for their
“Χωξισμον
απο τκ
Εωμαιος,
εις το
καλως
φιλοσοφειν”——[their]
“getting out of the body, in order to think well.”</p>

<p>No man thinks right, whilst he is in it; blinded as he must be,
with his congenial humours, and drawn differently aside, as the
bishop and myself have been, with too lax or too tense a
fibre——R<small>EASON</small> is, half of it,
S<small>ENSE</small>; and the measure of heaven itself is but the
measure of our present appetites and concoctions.——</p>

<p>——But which of the two, in the present case, do you
think to be mostly in the wrong?</p>

<p>You, certainly: quoth she, to disturb a whole family so
early.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCVII</small>
</h3>

<p>——But she did not know I was under a vow not to
shave my beard till I got to <i>Paris;</i>——yet I hate
to make mysteries of nothing;——’tis the cold
cautiousness of one of those little souls from which <i>Lessius
(lib. 13. de moribus divinis, cap. 24.)</i> hath made his estimate,
wherein he setteth forth, That one <i>Dutch</i> mile, cubically
multiplied, will allow room enough, and to spare, for eight hundred
thousand millions, which he supposes to be as great a number of
souls (counting from the fall of <i>Adam</i>) as can possibly be
damn’d to the end of the world.</p>

<p>From what he has made this second estimate——unless
from the parental goodness of God—I don’t know—I
am much more at a loss what could be in <i>Franciscus
Ribbera</i>’s head, who pretends that no less a space than
one of two hundred <i>Italian</i> miles multiplied into itself,
will be sufficient to hold the like number——he
certainly must have gone upon some of the old <i>Roman</i> souls,
of which he had read, without reflecting how much, by a gradual and
most tabid decline, in the course of eighteen hundred years, they
must unavoidably have shrunk so as to have come, when he wrote,
almost to nothing.</p>

<p>In <i>Lessius</i>’s time, who seems the cooler man, they
were as little as can be imagined——</p>

<p>——We find them less <i>now</i>——</p>

<p>And next winter we shall find them less again; so that if we go
on from little to less, and from less to nothing, I hesitate not
one moment to affirm, that in half a century at this rate, we shall
have no souls at all; which being the period beyond which I doubt
likewise of the existence of the Christian faith, ’twill be
one advantage that both of ’em will be exactly worn out
together.</p>

<p>Blessed <i>Jupiter!</i> and blessed every other heathen god and
goddess! for now ye will all come into play again, and with
<i>Priapus</i> at your tails——what jovial
times!——but where am I? and into what a delicious riot
of things am I rushing? I——I who must be cut short in
the midst of my days, and taste no more of ’em than what I
borrow from my imagination——peace to thee, generous
fool! and let me go on.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——“So hating, I say, to make mysteries
of <i>nothing</i>”——I intrusted it with the
post-boy, as soon as ever I got off the stones; he gave a crack
with his whip to balance the compliment; and with the thill-horse
trotting, and a sort of an up and a down of the other, we danced it
along to <i>Ailly au clochers</i>, famed in days of yore for the
finest chimes in the world; but we danced through it without
music—the chimes being greatly out of order—(as in
truth they were through all <i>France</i>).</p>

<p>And so making all possible speed, from</p>

<p><i>Ailly au clochers</i>, I got to <i>Hixcourt</i>,<br>
from <i>Hixcourt</i> I got to <i>Pequignay</i>, and<br>
from <i>Pequignay</i>, I got to A<small>MIENS</small>,<br>
concerning which town I have nothing to inform you, but what I have
informed you once before——and that was—that
<i>Janatone</i> went there to school.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCIX</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> the whole catalogue of those
whiffling vexations which come puffing across a man’s
canvass, there is not one of a more teasing and tormenting nature,
than this particular one which I am going to
describe——and for which (unless you travel with an
avance-courier, which numbers do in order to prevent
it)——there is no help: and it is this.</p>

<p>That be you in never so kindly a propensity to
sleep——though you are passing perhaps through the
finest country—upon the best roads, and in the easiest
carriage for doing it in the world——nay, was you sure you could sleep fifty miles straight
forwards, without once opening your eyes—nay, what is more,
was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can be of any truth in
<i>Euclid</i>, that you should upon all accounts be full as well
asleep as awake——nay, perhaps better——Yet
the incessant returns of paying for the horses at every
stage,——with the necessity thereupon of putting your
hand into your pocket, and counting out from thence three livres
fifteen sous (sous by sous), puts an end to so much of the project,
that you cannot execute above six miles of it (or supposing it is a
post and a half, that is but nine)——were it to save
your soul from destruction.</p>

<p>—I’ll be even with ’em, quoth I, for
I’ll put the precise sum into a piece of paper, and hold it
ready in my hand all the way: “Now I shall have nothing
to do,” said I (composing myself to rest), “but
to drop this gently into the post-boy’s hat, and not say a
word.”——Then there wants two sous more to
drink——or there is a twelve sous piece of <i>Louis</i> XIV. which will
not pass—or a livre and some odd liards to be brought over
from the last stage, which Monsieur had forgot; which altercations
(as a man cannot dispute very well asleep) rouse him: still is
sweet sleep retrievable; and still might the flesh weigh down the
spirit, and recover itself of these blows—but then, by
heaven! you have paid but for a single post—whereas
’tis a post and a half; and this obliges you to pull out your
book of post-roads, the print of which is so very small, it forces
you to open your eyes, whether you will or no: Then Monsieur <i>le
Curé</i> offers you a pinch of snuff——or a poor
soldier shews you his leg——or a shaveling his
box——or the priestesse of the cistern will water your
wheels——they do not want it——but she swears
by her <i>priesthood</i> (throwing it back) that they
do:——then you have all these points to argue, or
consider over in your mind; in doing of which, the rational powers
get so thoroughly awakened——you may get ’em to sleep
again as you can.</p>

<p>It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes, or I had
pass’d clean by the stables of
<i>Chantilly</i>——</p>

<p>——But the postillion first affirming, and then
persisting in it to my face, that there was no mark upon the two
sous piece, I open’d my eyes to be convinced—and seeing
the mark upon it as plain as my nose—I leap’d out of
the chaise in a passion, and so saw every thing at <i>Chantilly</i>
in spite.——I tried it but for three posts and a half,
but believe ’tis the best principle in the world to travel
speedily upon; for as few objects look very inviting in that
mood—you have little or nothing to stop you; by which means
it was that I passed through St. <i>Dennis</i>, without turning my
head so much as on one side towards the Abby——</p>

<p>——Richness of their treasury! stuff and
nonsense!——bating their jewels, which are all false, I
would not give three sous for any one thing in it, but
<i>Jaidas’s lantern</i>——nor for that either,
only as it grows dark, it might be of use.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;C</small>
</h3>

<p>C<small>RACK</small>, crack——crack,
crack——crack, crack—so this is <i>Paris!</i>
quoth I (continuing in the same mood)—and this is
<i>Paris!</i>——humph!——<i>Paris!</i> cried
I, repeating the name the third time——</p>

<p>The first, the finest, the most brilliant——</p>

<p>The streets however are nasty.</p>

<p>But it looks, I suppose, better than it
smells——crack, crack——crack,
crack——what a fuss thou makest!—as if it
concerned the good people to be informed, that a man with pale face
and clad in black, had the honour to be driven into <i>Paris</i> at
nine o’clock at night, by a postillion in a tawny yellow
jerkin, turned up with red calamanco—crack, crack——crack, crack——crack,
crack,——I wish thy whip——</p>

<p>——But ’tis the spirit of thy nation; so
crack—crack on.</p>

<p>Ha!——and no one gives the wall!——but in
the S<small>CHOOL</small> of U<small>RBANITY</small> herself, if
the walls are besh-t—how can you do otherwise?</p>

<p>And prithee when do they light the lamps? What?—never in
the summer months!——Ho! ’tis the time of
sallads.——O rare! sallad and soup—soup and
sallad—sallad and soup, <i>encore</i>——</p>

<p>——’Tis <i>too much</i> for sinners.</p>

<p>Now I cannot bear the barbarity of it; how can that
unconscionable coachman talk so much bawdy to that lean horse?
don’t you see, friend, the streets are so villanously narrow,
that there is not room in all <i>Paris</i> to turn a wheelbarrow?
In the grandest city of the whole world, it would not have been
amiss, if they had been left a thought wider; nay, were it only so
much in every single street, as that a man might know (was it
only for satisfaction) on which side of it he was
walking.</p>

<p>
One—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten.—Ten
cooks shops! and twice the number of barbers! and all within three minutes
driving! one would think that all the cooks in the world, on some great
merry-meeting with the barbers, by joint consent had said—Come, let us
all go live at <i>Paris:</i> the <i>French</i> love good
eating——they are all <i>gourmands</i>——we shall rank
high; if their god is their belly——their cooks must be gentlemen:
and forasmuch as <i>the periwig maketh the man</i>, and the periwig-maker
maketh the periwig—<i>ergo</i>, would the barbers say, we shall rank
higher still—we shall be above you all—we shall be
<i>Capitouls</i><a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> at least—<i>pardi!</i> we shall
all wear swords——
</p>

<p>—And so, one would swear, (that is, by
candle-light,—but there is no depending upon it,) they
continued to do, to this day.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;CI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> <i>French</i> are certainly
misunderstood:——but whether the fault is theirs, in not
sufficiently explaining themselves; or speaking with that exact
limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such
importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by
us——or whether the fault may not be altogether on our
side, in not understanding their language always so critically as
to know “what they would be at”——I shall
not decide; but ’tis evident to me, when they affirm,
“<i>That they who have seen</i> Paris, <i>have seen
every thing</i>,” they must mean to speak of those who have
seen it by day-light.</p>

<p>As for candle-light—I give it up——I have said
before, there was no depending upon it—and I repeat it again;
but not because the lights and shades are too sharp—or the
tints confounded—or that there is neither beauty or keeping,
&amp;c. . . . for that’s not truth—but it is an uncertain light in this respect, That in all the five
hundred grand Hôtels, which they number up to you in
<i>Paris</i>—and the five hundred good things, at a modest
computation (for ’tis only allowing one good thing to a
Hôtel), which by candle-light are best to be <i>seen, felt,
heard</i>, and <i>understood</i> (which, by the bye, is a quotation
from <i>Lilly</i>)——the devil a one of us out of fifty,
can get our heads fairly thrust in amongst them.</p>

<p>This is no part of the <i>French</i> computation: ’tis
simply this,</p>

<p>That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixteen, since which time there have been considerable
augmentations, <i>Paris</i> doth contain nine hundred streets;
(viz)</p>

<p>In the quarter called the <i>City</i>—there
are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty-three streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>James</i> of the Shambles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty-five streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Oportune</i>, thirty-four streets.</p>

<p>In the quarter of the <i>Louvre</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty-five streets.</p>

<p>In the <i>Palace Royal</i>, or St.
<i>Honorius</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-nine streets.</p>

<p>In <i>Mont. Martyr</i>, forty-one streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Eustace</i>, twenty-nine streets.</p>

<p>In the <i>Halles</i>, twenty-seven streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Dennis</i>, fifty-five streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Martin</i>, fifty-four streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Paul</i>, or the <i>Mortellerie</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty-seven streets.</p>

<p>The <i>Greve</i>, thirty-eight streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Avoy</i>, or the <i>Verrerie</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nineteen streets.</p>

<p>In the <i>Marais</i>, or the <i>Temple</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty-two streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Antony</i>’s, sixty-eight
streets.</p>

<p>In the <i>Place Maubert</i>, eighty-one streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Bennet</i>, sixty streets.</p>

<p>In St. <i>Andrews de Arcs</i>, fifty-one
streets.</p>

<p>In the quarter of the <i>Luxembourg</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixty-two streets.</p>

<p>And in that of St. Germain, fifty-five streets, into any of
which you may walk; and that when you have seen them with all that
belongs to them, fairly by day-light—their gates, their
bridges, their squares, their statues - - - and have crusaded it
moreover, through all their parish-churches, by no means omitting
St. <i>Roche</i> and <i>Sulpice</i> - - - and to crown all, have
taken a walk to the four palaces, which you may see, either with or
without the statues and pictures, just as you chuse—</p>

<p>——Then you will have seen——</p>

<p>——but ’tis what no one needeth to tell you,
for you will read of it yourself upon the portico of the
<i>Louvre</i>, in these words,</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> mentioning the word <i>gay</i> (as
in the close of the last chapter) it puts one (<i>i.e.</i> an
author) in mind of the word <i>spleen</i>——especially
if he has any thing to say upon it: not that by any
analysis—or that from any table of interest or genealogy,
there appears much more ground of alliance betwixt them, than
betwixt light and darkness, or any two of the most unfriendly
opposites in nature——only ’tis an undercraft of
authors to keep up a good understanding amongst words, as
politicians do amongst men—not knowing how near they may be
under a necessity of placing them to each other——which
point being now gain’d, and that I may place mine exactly to
my mind, I write it down here—</p>

<p class="center">
<small>S&nbsp;P&nbsp;L&nbsp;E&nbsp;E&nbsp;N</small>
</p>

<p>This, upon leaving <i>Chantilly</i>, I declared to be the best
principle in the world to travel speedily upon; but I gave it only as
matter of opinion. I still continue in the same
sentiments—only I had not then experience enough of its
working to add this, that though you do get on at a tearing rate,
yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time; for which
reason I here quit it entirely, and for ever, and ’tis
heartily at any one’s service—it has spoiled me the
digestion of a good supper, and brought on a bilious
diarrhœa, which has brought me back again to my first
principle on which I set out——and with which I shall
now scamper it away to the banks of the <i>Garonne</i>—</p>

<p>
——No;——I cannot stop a moment to give you the character
of the people—their genius—— their manners—their
customs—their laws——their religion—their
government— their manufactures—their commerce—their finances,
with all the resources and hidden springs which sustain them: qualified as I
may be, by spending three days and two nights amongst them, and during all that
time making these things the entire subject of my enquiries and
reflections——
</p>

<p>Still—still I must away——the roads are
paved—the posts are short—the days are
long—’tis no more than noon—I shall be at
<i>Fontainebleau</i> before the king——</p>

<p>—Was he going there? not that I know——</p>

it to Lord *******.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should lament from my

<small>DEDICATION</small>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opinion of Lord *******
is neither better nor worse, than it was of Mr. ***. Honours, like
impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local value to a bit
of base metal; but Gold and Silver will pass all the world over
without any other recommendation than their own weight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same good-will that
made me think of offering up half an hour’s amusement to Mr.
*** when out of place—operates more forcibly at present, as
half an hour’s amusement will be more serviceable and
refreshing after labour and sorrow, than after a philosophical
repast.</p>

<p>
Nothing is so perfectly <i>amusement</i> as a total change of ideas; no ideas
are so totally different as those of Ministers, and innocent Lovers: for which
reason, when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and set such marks upon
them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the
future—I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd,
</p>

<p class="poem">
Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray,<br>
Far as the Statesman’s walk or Patriot-way;<br>
Yet <i>simple Nature</i> to his hopes had given<br>
Out of a cloud-capp’d head a humbler heaven;<br>
Some <i>untam’d</i> World in depths of wood embraced—<br>
Some happier Island in the wat’ry-waste—<br>
And where admitted to that equal sky,<br>
His <i>faithful</i> Dogs should bear him company.
</p>

<p>
In a word, by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his Imagination,
I shall unavoidably give a <i>Diversion</i> to his passionate and love-sick
Contemplations. In the mean time,

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp; &nbsp;I</small><br>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> I hate to hear a person,
especially if he be a traveller, complain that we do not get on so
fast in <i>France</i> as we do in <i>England;</i> whereas we get on
much faster, <i>consideratis considerandis;</i> thereby always
meaning, that if you weigh their vehicles with the mountains of
baggage which you lay both before and behind upon them—and
then consider their puny horses, with the very little they give
them—’tis a wonder they get on at all: their suffering
is most unchristian, and ’tis evident thereupon to me, that a
<i>French</i> post-horse would not know what in the world to do,
was it not for the two words * * * * * * and * * * * * * in which there
is as much sustenance, as if you give him a peck of corn: now as
these words cost nothing, I long from my soul to tell the reader
what they are; but here is the question—they must be told him
plainly, and with the most distinct articulation, or it will answer
no end—and yet to do it in that plain way—though their
reverences may laugh at it in the bed-chamber—full well I
wot, they will abuse it in the parlour: for which cause, I have
been volving and revolving in my fancy some time, but to no
purpose, by what clean device or facette contrivance I might so
modulate them, that whilst I satisfy <i>that ear</i> which the
reader chuses to <i>lend</i> me—I might not dissatisfy the
other which he keeps to himself.</p>

<p>——My ink burns my finger to try——and
when I have——’twill have a worse
consequence——It will burn (I fear) my paper.</p>

<p>——No;——I dare not——</p>

<p>But if you wish to know how the <i>abbess</i> of
<i>Andoüillets</i> and a novice of her convent got over the
difficulty (only first wishing myself all imaginable
success)—I’ll tell you without the least scruple.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;II</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> abbess of
<i>Andoüillets</i>, which if you look into the large set of
provincial maps now publishing at <i>Paris</i>, you will find
situated amongst the hills which divide <i>Burgundy</i> from
<i>Savoy</i>, being in danger of an <i>Anchylosis</i> or stiff
joint (the <i>sinovia</i> of her knee becoming hard by long
matins), and having tried every remedy——first, prayers
and thanksgiving; then invocations to all the saints in heaven
promiscuously——then particularly to every saint who had
ever had a stiff leg before her——then touching it with
all the reliques of the convent, principally with the thigh-bone of
the man of <i>Lystra</i>, who had been impotent from his
youth——then wrapping it up in her veil when she went to
bed—then cross-wise her rosary—then bringing in to her
aid the secular arm, and anointing it with oils and hot fat of
animals——then treating it with emollient and resolving
fomentations——then with poultices of marsh-mallows,
mallows, bonus Henricus, white lillies and fenugreek—then
taking the woods, I mean the smoak of ’em, holding her
scapulary across her lap——then decoctions of wild
chicory, water-cresses, chervil, sweet cecily and
cochlearia——and nothing all this while answering, was
prevailed on at last to try the hot-baths of
<i>Bourbon</i>——so having first obtained leave of the
visitor-general to take care of her existence—she ordered all
to be got ready for her journey: a novice of the convent of about
seventeen, who had been troubled with a whitloe in her middle
finger, by sticking it constantly into the abbess’s cast
poultices, &amp;c.—had gained such an interest, that
overlooking a sciatical old nun, who might have been set up for ever by the hot-baths of <i>Bourbon,
Margarita</i>, the little novice, was elected as the companion of
the journey.</p>

<p>An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse, lined with green frize,
was ordered to be drawn out into the sun—the gardener of the
convent being chosen muleteer, led out the two old mules, to clip
the hair from the rump- ends of their tails, whilst a couple of
lay-sisters were busied, the one in darning the lining, and the
other in sewing on the shreds of yellow binding, which the teeth of
time had unravelled——the under-gardener dress’d
the muleteer’s hat in hot wine-lees——and a taylor
sat musically at it, in a shed over-against the convent, in
assorting four dozen of bells for the harness, whistling to each
bell, as he tied it on with a thong.——</p>

<p>——The carpenter and the smith of
<i>Andoüillets</i> held a council of wheels; and by seven, the
morning after, all look’d spruce, and was ready at the gate
of the convent for the hot-baths of
<i>Bourbon</i>—two rows of the unfortunate stood ready there
an hour before.</p>

<p>The abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>, supported by
<i>Margarita</i> the novice, advanced slowly to the calesh, both
clad in white, with their black rosaries hanging at their
breasts——</p>

<p>——There was a simple solemnity in the contrast: they
entered the calesh; the nuns in the same uniform, sweet emblem of
innocence, each occupied a window, and as the abbess and
<i>Margarita</i> look’d up—each (the sciatical poor nun
excepted)—each stream’d out the end of her veil in the
air—then kiss’d the lilly hand which let it go: the
good abbess and <i>Margarita</i> laid their hands saint-wise upon
their breasts—look’d up to heaven—then to
them—and look’d “God bless you, dear
sisters.”</p>

<p>I declare I am interested in this story, and wish I had been
there.</p>

<p>The gardener, whom I shall now call the muleteer, was a little,
hearty, broad-set, good-natured, chattering, toping kind of a
fellow, who troubled his head very little with the <i>hows</i> and
<i>whens</i> of life; so had mortgaged a month of his conventical
wages in a borrachio, or leathern cask of wine, which he had
disposed behind the calesh, with a large russet-coloured
riding-coat over it, to guard it from the sun; and as the weather
was hot, and he not a niggard of his labours, walking ten times
more than he rode—he found more occasions than those of
nature, to fall back to the rear of his carriage; till by frequent
coming and going, it had so happen’d, that all his wine had
leak’d out at the legal vent of the borrachio, before one
half of the journey was finish’d.</p>

<p>Man is a creature born to habitudes. The day had been
sultry—the evening was delicious—the wine was
generous—the <i>Burgundian</i> hill on which it grew was
steep—a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage
at the foot of it, hung vibrating in full harmony with the
passions—a gentle air rustled distinctly through the
leaves—“Come—come, thirsty
muleteer,—come in.”</p>

<p>—The muleteer was a son of <i>Adam</i>, I need not say a
word more. He gave the mules, each of ’em, a sound lash, and
looking in the abbess’s and <i>Margarita</i>’s faces
(as he did it)—as much as to say “here I
am”—he gave a second good crack—as much as to say
to his mules, “get on”——so slinking behind,
he enter’d the little inn at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>The muleteer, as I told you, was a little, joyous, chirping
fellow, who thought not of to-morrow, nor of what had gone before,
or what was to follow it, provided he got but his scantling of
Burgundy, and a little chit-chat along with it; so entering into a
long conversation, as how he was chief gardener to the convent of
<i>Andoüillets</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. and out of friendship for
the abbess and Mademoiselle <i>Margarita</i>, who was only in her
noviciate, he had come along with them from the confines of
<i>Savoy</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.—and as how she had got a white
swelling by her devotions—and what a nation of herbs he had procured to mollify her humours,
&amp;c. &amp;c. and that if the waters of <i>Bourbon</i> did not
mend that leg—she might as well be lame of both—&amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c.—He so contrived his story, as absolutely to
forget the heroine of it—and with her the little novice, and
what was a more ticklish point to be forgot than both—the two
mules; who being creatures that take advantage of the world,
inasmuch as their parents took it of them—and they not being
in a condition to return the obligation <i>downwards</i> (as men
and women and beasts are)—they do it side-ways, and
long-ways, and back-ways—and up hill, and down hill, and
which way they can.——Philosophers, with all their
ethicks, have never considered this rightly—how should the
poor muleteer, then in his cups, consider it at all? he did not in
the least—’tis time we do; let us leave him then in the
vortex of his element, the happiest and most thoughtless of mortal
men—and for a moment let us look after the mules, the abbess,
and <i>Margarita.</i></p>

<p>By virtue of the muleteer’s two last strokes the mules had
gone quietly on, following their own consciences up the hill, till
they had conquer’d about one half of it; when the elder of
them, a shrewd crafty old devil, at the turn of an angle, giving a
side glance, and no muleteer behind them,——</p>

<p>By my fig! said she, swearing, I’ll go no
further——And if I do, replied the other, they shall
make a drum of my hide.——</p>

<p>And so with one consent they stopp’d
thus——</p>

<h3>

<p>——Get on with you, said the abbess.</p>

<p>
——Wh - - - - - ysh——ysh——cried
<i>Margarita.</i>

</p>

<p>
——Whu—v—w—whew—w—w—whuv’d
<i>Margarita</i>, pursing up her sweet lips betwixt a hoot and a whistle.
</p>

<p>Thump—thump—thump—obstreperated the
abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i> with the end of her gold-headed
cane against the bottom of the calesh——</p>

<p>The old mule let a f—</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;IV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>E</small> are ruin’d and undone, my
child, said the abbess to <i>Margarita</i>,——we shall
be here all night——we shall be
plunder’d——we shall be ravished——</p>

<p>——We shall be ravish’d, said <i>Margarita</i>,
as sure as a gun.</p>

<p><i>Sancta Maria!</i> cried the abbess (forgetting the
<i>O!</i>)—why was I govern’d by this
wicked stiff joint? why did I leave the convent of
<i>Andoüillets?</i> and why didst thou not suffer thy servant
to go unpolluted to her tomb?</p>

<p>O my finger! my finger! cried the novice, catching fire at the
word <i>servant</i>—why was I not content to put it here, or
there, any where rather than be in this strait?</p>

<p>Strait! said the abbess.</p>

<p>Strait——said the novice; for terror had struck their
understandings——the one knew not what she
said——the other what she answer’d.</p>

<p>O my virginity! virginity! cried the abbess.</p>

<p>——inity!——inity! said the novice,
sobbing.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;V</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> dear mother, quoth the novice,
coming a little to herself,—there are two certain words,
which I have been told will force any horse, or ass, or mule, to go
up a hill whether he will or no; be he never so obstinate or
ill-will’d, the moment he hears them utter’d, he obeys.
They are words magic! cried the abbess in the utmost
horror—No; replied <i>Margarita</i> calmly—but they are
words sinful—What are they? quoth the abbess, interrupting
her: They are sinful in the first degree, answered
<i>Margarita</i>,—they are mortal—and if we are
ravished and die unabsolved of them, we shall
both——but you may pronounce them to me, quoth the
abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>——They cannot, my dear
mother, said the novice, be pronounced at all; they will make all
the blood in one’s body fly up into one’s
face—But you may whisper them in my ear, quoth the
abbess.</p>

<p>Heaven! hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at
the bottom of the hill? was there no generous and friendly spirit
unemployed——no agent in nature, by some monitory
shivering, creeping along the artery which led to his heart, to
rouse the muleteer from his banquet?——no sweet
minstrelsy to bring back the fair idea of the abbess and
<i>Margarita</i>, with their black rosaries!</p>

<p>Rouse! rouse!——but ’tis too late—the
horrid words are pronounced this moment——</p>

<p>——and how to tell them—Ye, who can speak of
every thing existing, with unpolluted lips—instruct
me——guide me——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;VI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>LL</small> sins whatever, quoth the abbess,
turning casuist in the distress they were under, are held by the
confessor of our convent to be either mortal or venial: there is no
further division. Now a venial sin being the slightest and least of
all sins—being halved—by taking either only the half of
it, and leaving the rest—or, by taking it all, and amicably
halving it betwixt yourself and another person—in course
becomes diluted into no sin at all.</p>

<p>Now I see no sin in saying, <i>bou, bou, bou, bou, bou</i>, a
hundred times together; nor is there any turpitude in pronouncing
the syllable <i>ger, ger, ger, ger, ger</i>, were it from our
matins to our vespers: Therefore, my dear daughter, continued the
abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>—I will say <i>bou</i>, and
thou shalt say <i>ger;</i> and then alternately, as there is no
more sin in <i>fou</i> than in <i>bou</i>—Thou shalt say
<i>fou</i>—and I will come in (like fa, sol, la, re, mi, ut,
at our complines) with <i>ter.</i> And accordingly the
abbess, giving the pitch note, set off thus:</p>

<p>
Abbess, )  Bou - - bou - - bou - -<br>
<i>Margarita</i>,) ——ger, - - ger, - - ger.<br>
<i>Margarita</i>,)  Fou...fou...fou..<br>
Abbess, ) —ter, - - ter, - - ter.
</p>

<p>
The two mules acknowledged the notes by a mutual lash of their tails; but it
went no further——’Twill answer by an’ by, said the
novice.
</p>

<p>
Abbess, )  Bou. bou. bou. bou. bou. bou.<br>
Margarita,) —ger, ger, ger, ger, ger, ger.
</p>

<p>
Quicker still, cried <i>Margarita.</i>
</p>

<p>
Fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou.
</p>

<p>
Quicker still, cried <i>Margarita.</i>
</p>

<p>
Bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou.
</p>

<p>
Quicker still—God preserve me; said the abbess—They do not
understand us, cried <i>Margarita</i>—But the Devil does, said the abbess
of <i>Andoüillets.</i>
</p>

<p>W<small>HAT</small> a tract of country have I
run!—how many degrees nearer to the warm sun am I advanced,
and how many fair and goodly cities have I seen, during the time
you have been reading and reflecting, Madam, upon this story!
There’s F<small>ONTAINBLEAU</small>, and S<small>ENS</small>,
and J<small>OIGNY</small>, and A<small>UXERRE</small>, and
D<small>IJON</small> the capital of <i>Burgundy</i>, and
C<small>HALLON</small>, and <i>Mâcon</i> the capital of the
<i>Maconese</i>, and a score more upon the road to
L<small>YONS</small>——and now I have run them
over——I might as well talk to you of so many market
towns in the moon, as tell you one word about them: it will be this
chapter at the least, if not both this and the next entirely lost,
do what I will——</p>

<p>—Why, ’tis a strange story! <i>Tristram.</i></p>

<p>——Alas! Madam,</p>

<p>had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the
cross—the peace of meekness, or the contentment of
resignation——I had not been incommoded: or had I thought of writing
it upon the purer abstractions of the soul, and that food of wisdom
and holiness and contemplation, upon which the spirit of man (when
separated from the body) is to subsist for ever——You
would have come with a better appetite from it——</p>

<p>——I wish I never had wrote it: but as I never blot
any thing out——let us use some honest means to get it
out of our heads directly.</p>

<p>——Pray reach me my fool’s cap——I
fear you sit upon it, Madam——’tis under the
cushion——I’ll put it on——</p>

<p>Bless me! you have had it upon your head this half
hour.——There then let it stay, with a</p>

<p>Fa-ra diddle di</p>

<p>and a fa-ri diddle d</p>

<p>and a high-dum—dye-dum</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fiddle - - - dumb - c.</p>

<p>And now, Madam, we may venture, I hope a little to
go on.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>——All you need say of <i>Fontainbleau</i> (in case
you are ask’d) is, that it stands about forty miles (south
something) from <i>Paris</i>, in the middle of a large
forest<i>—</i>That there is something great in
it<i>—</i>That the king goes there once every two or three
years, with his whole court, for the pleasure of the
chace—and that, during that carnival of sporting, any
<i>English</i> gentleman of fashion (you need not forget yourself)
may be accommodated with a nag or two, to partake of the sport,
taking care only not to out-gallop the king——</p>

<p>Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this
to every one.</p>

<p>First, Because ’twill make the said nags the harder to be
got; and</p>

<p>Secondly, ’Tis not a word of it
true.——<i>Allons!</i></p>

<p>As for S<small>ENS</small>——you may
dispatch—in a word——“<i>’Tis an
archiepiscopal see.</i>”</p>

<p>——For J<small>OIGNY</small>—the less, I think,
one says of it the better.</p>

<p>But for A<small>UXERRE</small>—I could go on for ever: for
in my <i>grand tour</i> through <i>Europe</i>, in which, after all,
my father (not caring to trust me with any one) attended me
himself, with my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and <i>Trim</i>, and
<i>Obadiah</i>, and indeed most of the family, except my mother,
who being taken up with a project of knitting my father a pair of
large worsted breeches—(the thing is common sense)—and
she not caring to be put out of her way, she staid at home, at
S<small>HANDY</small> H<small>ALL</small>, to keep things right
during the expedition; in which, I say, my father stopping us two
days at <i>Auxerre</i>, and his researches being ever of such a
nature, that they would have found fruit even in a
desert——he has left me enough to say upon
A<small>UXERRE</small>: in short, wherever my father
went——but ’twas more remarkably so, in this
journey through <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>, than in any other
stages of his life—his road seemed to lie so much on one
side of that, wherein all other travellers have gone before
him—he saw kings and courts and silks of all colours, in such
strange lights——and his remarks and reasonings upon the
characters, the manners, and customs of the countries we
pass’d over, were so opposite to those of all other mortal
men, particularly those of my uncle <i>Toby</i> and
<i>Trim</i>—(to say nothing of myself)—and to crown
all—the occurrences and scrapes which we were perpetually
meeting and getting into, in consequence of his systems and
opiniotry—they were of so odd, so mix’d and
tragi-comical a contexture—That the whole put together, it
appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of
<i>Europe</i>, which was ever executed—that I will venture to
pronounce—the fault must be mine and mine only—if it be
not read by all travellers and travel-readers, till travelling is
no more,—or which comes to the same point—till the
world, finally, takes it into its head to stand
still.——</p>

<p>——But this rich bale is not to be open’d now;
except a small thread or two of it, merely to unravel the mystery
of my father’s stay at A<small>UXERRE</small>.</p>

<p>——As I have mentioned it—’tis too slight
to be kept suspended; and when ’tis wove in, there is an end
of it.</p>

<p>We’ll go, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, whilst
dinner is coddling—to the abbey of Saint <i>Germain</i>, if
it be only to see these bodies, of which Monsieur <i>Sequier</i>
has given such a recommendation.——I’ll go see any
body, quoth my uncle <i>Toby;</i> for he was all compliance through
every step of the journey——Defend me! said my
father—they are all mummies——Then one need not
shave; quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>——Shave!
no—cried my father—’twill be more like relations
to go with our beards on—So out we sallied, the corporal
lending his master his arm, and bringing up the rear, to the abbey
of Saint <i>Germain.</i></p>

<p>Every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and
very magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who was a younger brother of the order of
<i>Benedictines</i>—but our curiosity has led us to see the
bodies, of which Monsieur <i>Sequier</i> has given the world so
exact a description.—The sacristan made a bow, and lighting a
torch first, which he had always in the vestry ready for the
purpose; he led us into the tomb of St.
<i>Heribald</i>——This, said the sacristan, laying his
hand upon the tomb, was a renowned prince of the house of
<i>Bavaria</i>, who under the successive reigns of <i>Charlemagne,
Louis le Debonnair</i>, and <i>Charles the Bald</i>, bore a great
sway in the government, and had a principal hand in bringing every
thing into order and discipline——</p>

<p>Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in
the cabinet——I dare say he has been a gallant
soldier——He was a monk—said the sacristan.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> sought comfort in each
other’s faces—but found it not: my father clapped both
his hands upon his cod-piece, which was a way he had when any thing
hugely tickled him: for though he hated a monk and the very smell
of a monk worse than all the devils in hell——yet the
shot hitting my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> so much harder
than him, ’twas a relative triumph; and put him into the
gayest humour in the world.</p>

<p>——And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my
father, rather sportingly: This tomb, said the young
<i>Benedictine</i>, looking downwards, contains the bones of Saint
M<small>AXIMA</small>, who came from <i>Ravenna</i> on purpose to
touch the body——</p>

<p>——Of Saint M<small>AXIMUS</small>, said my father,
popping in with his saint before him,—they were two of the
greatest saints in the whole martyrology, added my
father——Excuse me, said the
sacristan——’twas to touch the bones of Saint
<i>Germain</i>, the builder of the abbey——And what did
she get by it? said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——What does any
woman get by it? said my
father——M<small>ARTYRDOME</small>; replied the young
<i>Benedictine</i>, making a bow down to the ground, and
uttering the word with so humble, but decisive a cadence, it
disarmed my father for a moment. ’Tis supposed, continued the
<i>Benedictine</i>, that St. <i>Maxima</i> has lain in this tomb
four hundred years, and two hundred before her
canonization——’Tis but a slow rise, brother
<i>Toby</i>, quoth my father, in this self-same army of
martyrs.——A desperate slow one, an’ please your
honour, said <i>Trim</i>, unless one could purchase——I
should rather sell out entirely, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——I am pretty much of your opinion, brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father.</p>

<p>——Poor St. <i>Maxima!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>
low to himself, as we turn’d from her tomb: She was one of
the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of <i>Italy</i> or
<i>France</i>, continued the sacristan——But who the
duce has got lain down here, besides her? quoth my father, pointing
with his cane to a large tomb as we walked on——It is
Saint <i>Optat</i>, Sir, answered the sacristan——And
properly is Saint <i>Optat</i> plac’d! said my father: And
what is Saint <i>Optat</i>’s story? continued he. Saint <i>Optat</i>, replied the sacristan, was a
bishop——</p>

<p>——I thought so, by heaven! cried my father,
interrupting him—Saint <i>Optat!</i>——how should
Saint <i>Optat</i> fail? so snatching out his pocket-book, and the
young <i>Benedictine</i> holding him the torch as he wrote, he set
it down as a new prop to his system of Christian names, and I will
be bold to say, so disinterested was he in the search of truth,
that had he found a treasure in Saint <i>Optat</i>’s tomb, it
would not have made him half so rich: ’Twas as successful a
short visit as ever was paid to the dead; and so highly was his
fancy pleas’d with all that had passed in it,—that he
determined at once to stay another day in <i>Auxerre.</i></p>

<p>—I’ll see the rest of these good gentry to-morrow,
said my father, as we cross’d over the square—And while
you are paying that visit, brother <i>Shandy</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—the corporal and I will mount the ramparts.</p>

<p>
——N<small>OW</small> this is the most puzzled skein of
all——for in this last chapter, as far at least as it has
help’d me through <i>Auxerre</i>, I have been getting forwards in two
different journies together, and with the same dash of the pen—for I have
got entirely out of <i>Auxerre</i> in this journey which I am writing now, and
I am got half way out of <i>Auxerre</i> in that which I shall write
hereafter——There is but a certain degree of perfection in every
thing; and by pushing at something beyond that, I have brought myself into such
a situation, as no traveller ever stood before me; for I am this moment walking
across the market-place of <i>Auxerre</i> with my father and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, in our way back to dinner——and I am this moment also
entering <i>Lyons</i> with my post-chaise broke into a thousand
pieces—and I am moreover this moment in a handsome pavillion built by
<i>Pringello</i>,<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> upon the banks of the <i>Garonne</i>,
which Mons. <i>Sligniac</i> has lent me, and where I now sit rhapsodising all
these affairs.
</p>

<p>——Let me collect myself, and pursue my journey.</p>

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>I <small>AM</small> glad of it, said I, settling the
account with myself, as I walk’d into
<i>Lyons</i>——my chaise being all laid
higgledy-piggledy with my baggage in a cart, which was moving
slowly before me——I am heartily glad, said I, that
’tis all broke to pieces; for now I can go directly by water
to <i>Avignon</i>, which will carry me on a hundred and twenty
miles of my journey, and not cost me seven livres——and
from thence, continued I, bringing forwards the account, I can
hire a couple of mules—or asses, if I like, (for
nobody knows me,) and cross the plains of <i>Languedoc</i> for
almost nothing——I shall gain four hundred livres by the
misfortune clear into my purse: and pleasure! worth—worth
double the money by it. With what velocity, continued I, clapping
my two hands together, shall I fly down the rapid
<i>Rhône</i>, with the V<small>IVARES</small> on my right
hand, and D<small>AUPHINY</small> on my left, scarce seeing the
ancient cities of V<small>IENNE</small>, <i>Valence</i>, and
<i>Vivieres.</i> What a flame will it rekindle in the lamp, to
snatch a blushing grape from the <i>Hermitage</i> and <i>Cotê
roti</i>, as I shoot by the foot of them! and what a fresh spring
in the blood! to behold upon the banks advancing and retiring, the
castles of romance, whence courteous knights have whilome rescued
the distress’d——and see vertiginous, the rocks,
the mountains, the cataracts, and all the hurry which Nature is in
with all her great works about her.</p>

<p>
As I went on thus, methought my chaise, the wreck of which look’d stately
enough at the first, insensibly grew less and less in its size; the freshness
of the painting was no more—the gilding lost its lustre—and the
whole affair appeared so poor in my eyes—so sorry!—so contemptible!
and, in a word, so much worse than the abbess of <i>Andoüillets’</i>
itself—that I was just opening my mouth to give it to the
devil—when a pert vamping chaise-undertaker, stepping nimbly across the
street, demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refitted——No,
no, said I, shaking my head sideways—Would Monsieur choose to sell it?
rejoined the undertaker—With all my soul, said I—the iron work is
worth forty livres—and the glasses worth forty more—and the leather
you may take to live on.
</p>

<p>What a mine of wealth, quoth I, as he counted me the money, has
this post-chaise brought me in? And this is my usual method of
book-keeping, at least with the disasters of life—making a
penny of every one of ’em as they happen to
me——</p>

<p>——Do, my dear <i>Jenny</i>, tell the world for me,
how I behaved under one, the most oppressive of its kind, which
could befal me as a man, proud as he ought to be of his
manhood——</p>

<p>’Tis enough, saidst thou, coming close up to me, as I
stood with my garters in my hand, reflecting upon what had not
pass’d——’Tis enough, <i>Tristram</i>, and I
am satisfied, saidst thou, whispering these words in my ear, * * *
* &nbsp;* * &nbsp;* * * * &nbsp;* * * &nbsp;* * * * * *;—* *
* * * * &nbsp;* * *——any other man would have sunk down
to the centre——</p>

<p>——Every thing is good for something, quoth I.</p>

<p>——I’ll go into <i>Wales</i> for six weeks, and
drink goat’s whey—and I’ll gain seven years
longer life for the accident. For which reason I think myself
inexcusable, for blaming Fortune so often as I have done, for
pelting me all my life long, like an ungracious duchess, as I
call’d her, with so many small evils: surely, if I have any
cause to be angry with her, ’tis that she has not sent me great
ones—a score of good cursed, bouncing losses, would have been
as good as a pension to me.</p>

<p>——One of a hundred a year, or so, is all I
wish—I would not be at the plague of paying land-tax for a
larger.</p>

<p>T<small>O</small> those who call vexations,
<small>VEXATIONS</small>, as knowing what they are, there could not
be a greater, than to be the best part of a day at <i>Lyons</i>,
the most opulent and flourishing city in <i>France</i>, enriched
with the most fragments of antiquity—and not be able to see
it. To be withheld upon <i>any</i> account, must be a vexation; but
to be withheld <i>by</i> a vexation——must certainly be,
what philosophy justly calls</p>

<p class="center">
<small>VEXATION</small><br>
upon<br>
<small>VEXATION</small>.
</p>

<p>I had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is
excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and
coffee together—otherwise ’tis only coffee and
milk)—and as it was no more than eight in the morning, and
the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see enough of
<i>Lyons</i> to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the
world with it. I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking
at my list, and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of
<i>Lippius</i> of <i>Basil</i>, in the first
place——</p>

<p>Now, of all things in the world, I understand the least of
mechanism——I have neither genius, or taste, or
fancy—and have a brain so entirely unapt for every thing of
that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to
comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common
knife-grinder’s wheel—tho’ I have many an hour of
my life look’d up with great devotion at the one—and
stood by with as much patience as any christian ever could do, at the
other——</p>

<p>I’ll go see the surprising movements of this great clock,
said I, the very first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to
the great library of the Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight
of the thirty volumes of the general history of <i>China</i>, wrote
(not in the <i>Tartarean</i>, but) in the <i>Chinese</i> language,
and in the <i>Chinese</i> character too.</p>

<p>Now I almost know as little of the <i>Chinese</i> language, as I
do of the mechanism of <i>Lippius</i>’s clock-work; so, why
these should have jostled themselves into the two first articles of
my list——I leave to the curious as a problem of Nature.
I own it looks like one of her ladyship’s obliquities; and
they who court her, are interested in finding out her humour as
much as I.</p>

<p>When these curiosities are seen, quoth I, half addressing myself
to my <i>valet de place</i>, who stood behind
me——’twill be no hurt if we go to the church of
St. <i>Irenæus</i>, and see the pillar to which
<i>Christ</i> was tied——and after that, the house
where <i>Pontius Pilate</i> lived——’Twas at the
next town, said the <i>valet de place</i>—at <i>Vienne;</i> I
am glad of it, said I, rising briskly from my chair, and walking
across the room with strides twice as long as my usual
pace——“for so much the sooner shall I be at
the <i>Tomb of the two lovers.</i>”</p>

<p>What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long
strides in uttering this——I might leave to the curious
too; but as no principle of clock-work is concerned in
it——’twill be as well for the reader if I explain
it myself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XII</small>
</h3>

<p>O! <small>THERE</small> is a sweet æra
in the life of man, when (the brain being tender and fibrillous,
and more like pap than any thing else)——a story read of
two fond lovers, separated from each other by cruel parents, and by
still more cruel destiny——</p>

<p>
     <i>Amandus</i>——He<br>
     <i>Amanda</i>——She——<br>

each ignorant of the other’s course,<br>
     He——east<br>
     She——west<br>
<i>Amandus</i> taken captive by the <i>Turks</i>, and carried to
the emperor of <i>Morocco</i>’s court, where the princess of
<i>Morocco</i> falling in love with him, keeps him twenty years in
prison for the love of his <i>Amanda.</i>——</p>

<p>She—(<i>Amanda</i>) all the time wandering barefoot, and
with dishevell’d hair, o’er rocks and mountains,
enquiring for <i>Amandus!——Amandus!
Amandus!—</i>making every hill and valley to echo back
his name——</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Amandus! Amandus!</i>
</p>

<p>at every town and city, sitting down forlorn at the
gate——Has Amandus!—has my <i>Amandus</i>
enter’d?——till,——going round, and
round, and round the world——chance unexpected bringing
them at the same moment of the night, though by different ways, to
the gate of <i>Lyons</i>, their native city, and each in
well-known accents calling out aloud,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is <i>Amandus</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
still alive?</p>

<p>
Is my <i>Amanda</i>
</p>

<p>they fly into each other’s arms, and both drop
down dead for joy.</p>

<p>There is a soft æra in every gentle mortal’s life,
where such a story affords more <i>pabulum</i> to the brain, than
all the <i>Frusts</i>, and <i>Crusts</i>, and <i>Rusts</i> of
antiquity, which travellers can cook up for it.</p>

<p>——’Twas all that stuck on the right side of
the cullender in my own, of what <i>Spon</i> and others, in their
accounts of <i>Lyons</i>, had <i>strained</i> into it; and finding,
moreover, in some Itinerary, but in what God
knows——That sacred to the fidelity of <i>Amandus</i>
and <i>Amanda</i>, a tomb was built without the gates, where, to
this hour, lovers called upon them to attest their
truths——I never could get into a scrape of that kind in
my life, but this <i>tomb of the lovers</i> would, somehow or
other, come in at the close&nbsp;—nay such a kind of empire had it establish’d over
me, that I could seldom think or speak of <i>Lyons</i>—and
sometimes not so much as see even a <i>Lyons-waistcoat</i>, but
this remnant of antiquity would present itself to my fancy; and I
have often said in my wild way of running
on——tho’ I fear with some
irreverence——“I thought this shrine
(neglected as it was) as valuable as that of <i>Mecca</i>, and so
little short, except in wealth, of the <i>Santa Casa</i> itself,
that some time or other, I would go a pilgrimage (though I had no
other business at <i>Lyons</i>) on purpose to pay it a
visit.”</p>

<p>In my list, therefore, of <i>Videnda</i> at <i>Lyons</i>, this,
tho’ <i>last</i>,—was not, you see, <i>least</i>&nbsp;;
so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual cross my
room, just whilst it passed my brain, I walked down calmly into the
<i>basse cour</i>, in order to sally forth; and having called for
my bill—as it was uncertain whether I should return to my
inn, I had paid it——had moreover given the maid ten
sous, and was just receiving the dernier compliments of Monsieur <i>Le Blanc</i>, for a pleasant
voyage down the <i>Rhône</i>——when I was stopped
at the gate——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——’T<small>WAS</small> by a poor
ass, who had just turned in with a couple of large panniers upon
his back, to collect eleemosynary turnip-tops and cabbage-leaves;
and stood dubious, with his two fore-feet on the inside of the
threshold, and with his two hinder feet towards the street, as not
knowing very well whether he was to go in or no.</p>

<p>Now, ’tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear
to strike——there is a patient endurance of sufferings,
wrote so unaffectedly in his looks and carriage, which pleads so
mightily for him, that it always disarms me; and to that degree,
that I do not like to speak unkindly to him: on the contrary, meet
him where I will—whether in town or country—in cart or
under panniers—whether in liberty or bondage——I
have ever something civil to say to him on my part; and as one word
begets another (if he has as little to do as I)——I
generally fall into conversation with him; and surely never is my
imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings
of his countenance—and where those carry me not deep
enough—in flying from my own heart into his, and seeing what
is natural for an ass to think—as well as a man, upon the
occasion. In truth, it is the only creature of all the classes of
beings below me, with whom I can do this: for parrots, jackdaws,
&amp;c.——I never exchange a word with
them——nor with the apes, &amp;c. for pretty near the
same reason; they act by rote, as the others speak by it, and
equally make me silent: nay my dog and my cat, though I value them
both——(and for my dog he would speak if he
could)—yet somehow or other, they neither of them possess the
talents for conversation——I can make nothing of a
discourse with them, beyond the <i>proposition</i>, the
<i>reply</i>, and <i>rejoinder</i>, which terminated my
father’s and my mother’s conversations, in his beds of
justice——and those
utter’d——there’s an end of the
dialogue——</p>

<p>—But with an ass, I can commune for ever.</p>

<p>Come, <i>Honesty!</i> said I,——seeing it was
impracticable to pass betwixt him and the gate——art
thou for coming in, or going out?</p>

<p>The ass twisted his head round to look up the
street——</p>

<p>Well—replied I—we’ll wait a minute for thy
driver:</p>

<p>——He turned his head thoughtful about, and looked
wistfully the opposite way——</p>

<p>I understand thee perfectly, answered I——If thou
takest a wrong step in this affair, he will cudgel thee to
death——Well! a minute is but a minute, and if it saves
a fellow-creature a drubbing, it shall not be set down as
ill-spent.</p>

<p>He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went
on, and in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger
and unsavouriness, had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times, and
pick’d it up again——God help thee, <i>Jack!</i>
said I, thou hast a bitter breakfast on’t—and many a
bitter day’s labour,—and many a bitter blow, I fear,
for its wages——’tis all—all bitterness to
thee, whatever life is to others.——And now thy mouth,
if one knew the truth of it, is as bitter, I dare say, as
soot—(for he had cast aside the stem) and thou hast not a
friend perhaps in all this world, that will give thee a
macaroon.——In saying this, I pull’d out a paper
of ’em, which I had just purchased, and gave him
one—and at this moment that I am telling it, my heart smites
me, that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit, of seeing
<i>how</i> an ass would eat a macaroon——than of
benevolence in giving him one, which presided in the act.</p>

<p>When the ass had eaten his macaroon, I press’d him to come
in——the poor beast was heavy loaded——his
legs seem’d to tremble under him——he hung rather
backwards, and as I pull’d at his halter, it broke short in my hand——he
look’d up pensive in my face—“Don’t
thrash me with it—but if you will, you
may”——If I do, said I, I’ll be
d——d.</p>

<p>The word was but one-half of it pronounced, like the abbess of
<i>Andoüillet</i>’s—(so there was no sin in
it)—when a person coming in, let fall a thundering bastinado
upon the poor devil’s crupper, which put an end to the
ceremony.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out upon it!</i></p>

<p>cried I——but the interjection was
equivocal——and, I think, wrong placed too—for the
end of an osier which had started out from the contexture of the
ass’s panier, had caught hold of my breeches pocket, as he
rush’d by me, and rent it in the most disastrous direction
you can imagine——so that the</p>

<p><i>Out upon it!</i> in my opinion, should have come in
here——but this I leave to be settled by</p>

<p class="center">The<br>
<small>REVIEWERS</small><br>
of<br>
<small>MY BREECHES,</small></p>

<p>which I have brought over along with me for that
purpose.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> all was set to rights, I came
down stairs again into the <i>basse cour</i> with my <i>valet de
place</i>, in order to sally out towards the tomb of the two
lovers, &amp;c.—and was a second time stopp’d at the
gate——not by the ass—but by the person who struck
him; and who, by that time, had taken possession (as is not
uncommon after a defeat) of the very spot of ground where the ass
stood.</p>

<p>It was a commissary sent to me from the post-office, with a
rescript in his hand for the payment of some six livres odd
sous.</p>

<p>Upon what account? said I.——’Tis upon the part
of the king, replied the commissary, heaving up both his
shoulders——</p>

<p>——My good friend, quoth I——as sure as I
am I—and you are you——</p>

<p>——And who are you? said he.——</p>

<p>——Don’t puzzle me; said I.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XV</small>
</h3>

<p>——But it is an indubitable verity, continued I,
addressing myself to the commissary, changing only the form of my
asseveration——that I owe the king of <i>France</i>
nothing but my good will; for he is a very honest man, and I wish
him all health and pastime in the world——</p>

<p><i>Pardonnez moi</i>—replied the commissary, you are
indebted to him six livres four sous, for the next post from hence
to St. <i>Fons</i>, in your route to <i>Avignon</i>—which
being a post royal, you pay double for the horses and
postillion—otherwise ’twould have amounted to no more
than three livres two sous——</p>

<p>——But I don’t go by land; said I.</p>

<p>——You may if you please; replied the
commissary——</p>

<p>Your most obedient servant——said I, making him a low
bow——</p>

<p>The commissary, with all the sincerity of grave good
breeding—made me one, as low again.——I never was
more disconcerted with a bow in my life.</p>

<p>——The devil take the serious character of these
people! quoth I—(aside) they understand no more of Irony than
this——</p>

<p>The comparison was standing close by with his panniers—but
something seal’d up my lips—I could not pronounce the
name—</p>

<p>Sir, said I, collecting myself—it is not my intention to
take post——</p>

<p>—But you may—said he, persisting in his first
reply—you may take post if you chuse——</p>

<p>—And I may take salt to my pickled herring, said I, if I
chuse—</p>

<p>—But I do not chuse—</p>

<p>—But you must pay for it, whether you do or no.</p>

<p>Aye! for the salt; said I (I know)——</p>

<p>—And for the post too; added he. Defend me! cried
I——</p>

<p>I travel by water—I am going down the
<i>Rhône</i> this very afternoon—my baggage is in the
boat—and I have actually paid nine livres for my
passage——</p>

<p><i>C’est tout egal</i>—’tis all one; said
he.</p>

<p><i>Bon Dieu!</i> what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I
do <i>not</i> go!</p>

<p>——<i>C’est tout egal;</i> replied the
commissary——</p>

<p>——The devil it is! said I—but I will go to ten
thousand Bastiles first——</p>

<p><i>O England! England!</i> thou land of liberty, and
climate of good sense, thou tenderest of mothers—and gentlest
of nurses, cried I, kneeling upon one knee, as I was beginning my
apostrophè.</p>

<p>When the director of Madam <i>Le Blanc</i>’s conscience
coming in at that instant, and seeing a person in black, with a
face as pale as ashes, at his devotions—looking still paler
by the contrast and distress of his drapery—ask’d, if I
stood in want of the aids of the church——</p>

<p>I go by <small>WATER</small>—said I—and here’s
another will be for making me pay for going by
<small>OIL</small>.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> I perceived the commissary of the
post-office would have his six livres four sous, I had nothing else
for it, but to say some smart thing upon the occasion, worth the
money:</p>

<p>And so I set off thus:——</p>

<p>——And pray, Mr. Commissary, by what law of courtesy
is a defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you
use a <i>Frenchman</i> in this matter?</p>

<p>By no means; said he.</p>

<p>Excuse me; said I—for you have begun, Sir, with first
tearing off my breeches—and now you want my
pocket——</p>

<p>Whereas—had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your
own people—and then left me bare a—’d
after—I had been a beast to have
complain’d——</p>

<p>As it is——</p>

<p>——’Tis contrary to the <i>law of
nature.</i></p>

<p>——’Tis contrary to <i>reason.</i></p>

<p>——’Tis contrary to the
<small>GOSPEL</small>.</p>

<p>But not to this——said he—putting a printed
paper into my hand,</p>

<p class="center">P<small>AR le</small> R<small>OY</small>.</p>

<p>
———’Tis a pithy prolegomenon, quoth
I—and so read on — — — — —
— — — — — — — —
— — — — — — — —
— — — — — — — —
— — — — — — — —
— — — — — — —
</p>

<p>——By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it
over, a little too rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise
from <i>Paris</i>—he must go on travelling in one, all the
days of his life—or pay for it.—Excuse me, said the
commissary, the spirit of the ordinance is this—That if you
set out with an intention of running post from <i>Paris</i> to
<i>Avignon</i>, &amp;c. you shall not change that intention or mode
of travelling, without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts
further than the place you repent at—and ’tis founded,
continued he, upon this, that the <small>REVENUES</small> are not
to fall short through your <i>fickleness</i>——</p>

<p>——O by heavens! cried I—if
fickleness is taxable in <i>France</i>—we have nothing to do
but to make the best peace with you we can——</p>

<p><small>AND SO THE PEACE WAS MADE</small>;</p>

<p>——And if it is a bad one—as <i>Tristram
Shandy</i> laid the corner-stone of it—nobody but <i>Tristram
Shandy</i> ought to be hanged.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> I was sensible I had said as
many clever things to the commissary as came to six livres four
sous, yet I was determined to note down the imposition amongst my
remarks before I retired from the place; so putting my hand into my
coat-pocket for my remarks—(which, by the bye, may be a
caution to travellers to take a little more care of <i>their</i>
remarks for the future) “my remarks were
<i>stolen</i>”——Never did sorry traveller make
such a pother and racket about his remarks as I did about mine,
upon the occasion.</p>

<p>Heaven! earth! sea! fire! cried I, calling in every thing to my
aid but what I should——My remarks are
stolen!—what shall I do?——Mr. Commissary! pray
did I drop any remarks, as I stood besides you?——</p>

<p>You dropp’d a good many very singular ones; replied
he——Pugh! said I, those were but a few, not worth above
six livres two sous—but these are a large
parcel——He shook his head——Monsieur <i>Le
Blanc!</i> Madam <i>Le Blanc!</i> did you see any papers of
mine?—you maid of the house! run up
stairs—<i>François!</i> run up after
her——</p>

<p>—I must have my remarks——they were the best
remarks, cried I, that ever were made—the wisest—the
wittiest—What shall I do?—which way shall I turn
myself?</p>

<p><i>Sancho Pança</i>, when he lost his ass’s
<small>FURNITURE</small>, did not exclaim more bitterly.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> the first transport was over,
and the registers of the brain were beginning to get a little out
of the confusion into which this jumble of cross accidents had cast
them—it then presently occurr’d to me, that I had left
my remarks in the pocket of the chaise—and that in selling my
chaise, I had sold my remarks along with it, to the chaise-vamper.
        I leave this void space that the reader
may swear into it any oath that he is most accustomed
to——For my own part, if ever I swore a <i>whole</i>
oath into a vacancy in my life, I think it was into
that—— * * * * * * * * *, said I—and so my
remarks through <i>France</i>, which were as full of wit, as an egg
is full of meat, and as well worth four hundred guineas, as the
said egg is worth a penny—have I been selling here to a
chaise-vamper—for four <i>Louis d’Ors</i>—and
giving him a post-chaise (by heaven) worth six into the bargain;
had it been to <i>Dodsley</i>, or <i>Becket</i>, or any
creditable bookseller, who was either leaving off business, and
wanted a post-chaise—or who was beginning it—and wanted
my remarks, and two or three guineas along with them—I could
have borne it——but to a chaise-vamper!—shew me to
him this moment, <i>François</i>,—said I—The
valet de place put on his hat, and led the way—and I
pull’d off mine, as I pass’d the commissary, and
followed him.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XIX</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> we arrived at the
chaise-vamper’s house, both the house and the shop were shut
up; it was the eighth of <i>September</i>, the nativity of the
blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>, mother of God—</p>

<p>——Tantarra - ra - tan - tivi——the
whole world was gone out a May-poling—frisking
here—capering there——no body cared a button for
me or my remarks; so I sat me down upon a bench by the door,
philosophating upon my condition: by a better fate than usually attends me,
I had not waited half an hour, when the mistress came in to take
the papilliotes from off her hair, before she went to the
May-poles——</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> women, by the bye, love May-poles, <i>à
la folie</i>—that is, as much as their
matins——give ’em but a May-pole, whether in
<i>May, June, July</i> or <i>September</i>—they never count
the times——down it goes——’tis meat,
drink, washing, and lodging to ’em——and had we
but the policy, an’ please your worships (as wood is a little
scarce in <i>France</i>), to send them but plenty of
May-poles——</p>

<p>The women would set them up; and when they had done, they would
dance round them (and the men for company) till they were all
blind.</p>

<p>The wife of the chaise-vamper stepp’d in, I told you, to
take the papilliotes from off her hair——the toilet
stands still for no man——so she jerk’d off her
cap, to begin with them as she open’d the door, in doing
which, one of them fell upon the ground—I instantly saw it was my own
writing——</p>

<p>O Seigneur! cried I—you have got all my remarks upon your
head, Madam!——<i>J’en suis bien
mortifiée</i>, said she——’tis well, thinks
I, they have stuck there—for could they have gone deeper,
they would have made such confusion in a <i>French</i>
woman’s noddle—She had better have gone with it
unfrizled, to the day of eternity.</p>

<p><i>Tenez</i>—said she—so without any idea of the
nature of my suffering, she took them from her curls, and put them
gravely one by one into my hat——one was twisted this
way——another twisted that——ey! by my faith;
and when they are published, quoth I,——</p>

<p>They will be worse twisted still.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XX</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>NS</small> now for <i>Lippius</i>’s
clock! said I, with the air of a man, who had got thro’ all
his difficulties——nothing can prevent us seeing that,
and the <i>Chinese</i> history, &amp;c. except the time,
said <i>François</i>——for ’tis almost
eleven—then we must speed the faster, said I, striding it
away to the cathedral.</p>

<p>I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave me any concern in being
told by one of the minor canons, as I was entering the west
door,—That <i>Lippius</i>’s great clock was all out of
joints, and had not gone for some years——It will give
me the more time, thought I, to peruse the <i>Chinese</i> history;
and besides I shall be able to give the world a better account of
the clock in its decay, than I could have done in its flourishing
condition——</p>

<p>——And so away I posted to the college of the
Jesuits.</p>

<p>Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of
<i>China</i> in <i>Chinese</i> characters—as with many others
I could mention, which strike the fancy only at a distance; for as
I came nearer and nearer to the point—my blood
cool’d—the freak gradually went off, till at length I
would not have given a cherry-stone to have it gratified——The truth was, my time was
short, and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers——I
wish to God, said I, as I got the rapper in my hand, that the key
of the library may be but lost; it fell out as
well——</p>

<p><i>For all the</i> J<small>ESUITS</small> <i>had got the
cholic</i>—and to that degree, as never was known in the
memory of the oldest practitioner.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> I knew the geography of the Tomb
of the Lovers, as well as if I had lived twenty years in
<i>Lyons</i>, namely, that it was upon the turning of my right
hand, just without the gate, leading to the <i>Fauxbourg de
Vaise</i>——I dispatched <i>François</i> to the
boat, that I might pay the homage I so long ow’d it, without
a witness of my weakness—I walk’d with all imaginable
joy towards the place——when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb, my heart glowed within
me——</p>

<p>—Tender and faithful spirits! cried I, addressing myself
to <i>Amandus</i> and <i>Amanda</i>—long—long have I
tarried to drop this tear upon your tomb——I
come——I come——</p>

<p>When I came—there was no tomb to drop it upon.</p>

<p>What would I have given for my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to have
whistled Lillo bullero!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXII</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>O</small> matter how, or in what
mood—but I flew from the tomb of the lovers—or rather I
did not fly <i>from</i> it—(for there was no such thing
existing) and just got time enough to the boat to save my
passage;—and ere I had sailed a hundred yards, the
<i>Rhône</i> and the <i>Saôn</i> met together, and
carried me down merrily betwixt them.</p>

<p>But I have described this voyage down the <i>Rhône</i>,
before I made it——</p>

<p>——So now I am at <i>Avignon</i>, and as there is
nothing to see but the old house, in which the duke of
<i>Ormond</i> resided, and nothing to stop me but a short remark
upon the place, in three minutes you will see me crossing the
bridge upon a mule, with <i>François</i> upon a horse with
my portmanteau behind him, and the owner of both, striding the way
before us, with a long gun upon his shoulder, and a sword under his
arm, lest peradventure we should run away with his cattle. Had you
seen my breeches in entering <i>Avignon</i>,——Though
you’d have seen them better, I think, as I mounted—you
would not have thought the precaution amiss, or found in your heart
to have taken it in dudgeon; for my own part, I took it most
kindly; and determined to make him a present of them, when we got
to the end of our journey, for the trouble they had put him to, of
arming himself at all points against them.</p>

<p>Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon
<i>Avignon</i>, which is this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man’s
hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes
to <i>Avignon</i>,——that he should therefore say,
“<i>Avignon</i> is more subject to high winds than any town
in all <i>France:</i>” for which reason I laid no stress upon
the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it,
who telling me seriously it was so——and hearing,
moreover, the windiness of <i>Avignon</i> spoke of in the country
about as a proverb——I set it down, merely to ask the
learned what can be the cause——the consequence I
saw—for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and Counts,
there——the duce a Baron, in all
<i>Avignon</i>——so that there is scarce any talking to
them on a windy day.</p>

<p>Prithee, friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a
moment——for I wanted to pull off one of my jack-boots,
which hurt my heel—the man was standing quite idle at the
door of the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he was someway
concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his hand—so
begun with the boot:—when I had finished the affair, I turned
about to take the mule from the man, and thank
him——</p>

<p>——But <i>Monsieur le Marquis</i> had walked
in——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAD</small> now the whole south of
<i>France</i>, from the banks of the <i>Rhône</i> to those of
the <i>Garonne</i>, to traverse upon my mule at my own
leisure—<i>at my own leisure</i>——for I had left
Death, the Lord knows——and He only—how far behind
me——“I have followed many a man thro’
<i>France</i>, quoth he—but never at this mettlesome
rate.”——Still he followed,——and still
I fled him——but I fled him
cheerfully——still he pursued——but, like one
who pursued his prey without hope——as he lagg’d,
every step he lost, softened his looks——why should I
fly him at this rate?</p>

<p>So notwithstanding all the commissary of the post-office had
said, I changed the <i>mode</i> of my travelling once more; and,
after so precipitate and rattling a course as I had run, I
flattered my fancy with thinking of my mule, and that I should
traverse the rich plains of <i>Languedoc</i> upon his back, as
slowly as foot could fall.</p>

<p>There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller——or
more terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain;
especially if it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents
nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after
they have once told you, that ’tis delicious! or delightful!
(as the case happens)—that the soil was grateful, and that
nature pours out all her abundance, &amp;c. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they
have then a large plain upon their hands, which they know not what
to do with—and which is of little or no use to them but to
carry them to some town; and that town, perhaps of little more, but
a new place to start from to the next plain——and so
on.</p>

<p>—This is most terrible work; judge if I don’t manage
my plains better.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAD</small> not gone above two leagues and
a half, before the man with his gun began to look at his
priming.</p>

<p>I had three several times loiter’d <i>terribly</i> behind;
half a mile at least every time; once, in deep conference with a
drum-maker, who was making drums for the fairs of <i>Baucaira</i>
and <i>Tarascone</i>—I did not understand the
principles——</p>

<p>The second time, I cannot so properly say, I
stopp’d——for meeting a couple of
<i>Franciscans</i> straitened more for time than myself, and not
being able to get to the bottom of what I was about——I
had turn’d back with them——</p>

<p>The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a
hand-basket of <i>Provence</i> figs for four sous; this would have
been transacted at once; but for a case of conscience at the close
of it; for when the figs were paid for, it turn’d out,
that there were two dozen of eggs covered over with
vine-leaves at the bottom of the basket—as I had no intention
of buying eggs—I made no sort of claim of them—as for
the space they had occupied—what signified it? I had figs
enow for my money——</p>

<p>—But it was my intention to have the basket—it was
the gossip’s intention to keep it, without which, she could
do nothing with her eggs——and unless I had the basket,
I could do as little with my figs, which were too ripe already, and
most of ’em burst at the side: this brought on a short
contention, which terminated in sundry proposals, what we should
both do——</p>

<p>——How we disposed of our eggs and figs, I defy you,
or the Devil himself, had he not been there (which I am persuaded
he was), to form the least probable conjecture: You will read the
whole of it——not this year, for I am hastening to the
story of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s amours—but you will
read it in the collection of those which have arose out of the
journey across this plain—and which, therefore, I call
my</p>

<p class="center"><small>PLAIN STORIES.</small></p>

<p>How far my pen has been fatigued, like those of other
travellers, in this journey of it, over so barren a track—the
world must judge—but the traces of it, which are now all set
o’ vibrating together this moment, tell me ’tis the
most fruitful and busy period of my life; for as I had made no
convention with my man with the gun, as to time—by stopping
and talking to every soul I met, who was not in a full
trot—joining all parties before me—waiting for every
soul behind—hailing all those who were coming through
cross-roads—arresting all kinds of beggars, pilgrims,
fiddlers, friars—not passing by a woman in a mulberry-tree
without commending her legs, and tempting her into conversation
with a pinch of snuff——In short, by seizing every
handle, of what size or shape soever, which chance held out to me
in this journey—I turned my <i>plain</i> into a
<i>city</i>—I was always in company, and with great variety too; and
as my mule loved society as much as myself, and had some proposals
always on his part to offer to every beast he met—I am
confident we could have passed through <i>Pall-Mall</i>, or St.
<i>James</i>’s-Street, for a month together, with fewer
adventures—and seen less of human nature.</p>

<p>O! there is that sprightly frankness, which at once unpins every
plait of a <i>Languedocian</i>’s dress—that whatever is
beneath it, it looks so like the simplicity which poets sing of in
better days—I will delude my fancy, and believe it is so.</p>

<p>’Twas in the road betwixt <i>Nismes</i> and <i>Lunel</i>,
where there is the best <i>Muscatto</i> wine in all <i>France</i>,
and which by the bye belongs to the honest canons of
M<small>ONTPELLIER</small>—and foul befal the man who has
drunk it at their table, who grudges them a drop of it.</p>

<p>——The sun was set—they had done their work;
the nymphs had tied up their hair afresh—and the swains were
preparing for a carousal—my mule made a dead point——’Tis the fife
and tabourin, said I——I’m frighten’d to
death, quoth he——They are running at the ring of
pleasure, said I, giving him a prick——By saint
<i>Boogar</i>, and all the saints at the backside of the door of
purgatory, said he—(making the same resolution with the
abbesse of <i>Andoüillets</i>) I’ll not go a step
further——’Tis very well, sir, said
I——I never will argue a point with one of your family,
as long as I live; so leaping off his back, and kicking off one
boot into this ditch, and t’other into that—I’ll
take a dance, said I—so stay you here.</p>

<p>A sun-burnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet
me, as I advanced towards them; her hair, which was a dark chesnut
approaching rather to a black, was tied up in a knot, all but a
single tress.</p>

<p>We want a cavalier, said she, holding out both her hands, as if
to offer them—And a cavalier ye shall have; said I, taking
hold of both of them.</p>

<p>Hadst thou, <i>Nannette</i>, been array’d like a
duchesse!</p>

<p>——But that cursed slit in thy petticoat!</p>

<p><i>Nannette</i> cared not for it.</p>

<p>We could not have done without you, said she, letting go one
hand, with self-taught politeness, leading me up with the
other.</p>

<p>A lame youth, whom <i>Apollo</i> had recompensed with a pipe,
and to which he had added a tabourin of his own accord, ran sweetly
over the prelude, as he sat upon the bank——Tie me up
this tress instantly, said <i>Nannette</i>, putting a piece of
string into my hand—It taught me to forget I was a
stranger—— The whole knot fell
down——We had been seven years acquainted.</p>

<p>The youth struck the note upon the tabourin—his pipe
followed, and off we bounded——“the duce
take that slit!”</p>

<p>The sister of the youth, who had stolen her voice from heaven,
sung alternately with her brother——’twas a
<i>Gascoigne</i> roundelay.</p>

<p>VIVA LA JOIA!</p>

<p>
FIDON LA TRISTESSA!
</p>

<p>The nymphs join’d in unison, and their swains
an octave below them——</p>

<p>I would have given a crown to have it sew’d
up—<i>Nannette</i> would not have given a
<small>sous</small>—<i>Viva la joia!</i> was in her
lips—<i>Viva la joia!</i> was in her eyes. A transient
spark of amity shot across the space betwixt us——She
look’d amiable!——Why could I not live, and end my
days thus? Just Disposer of our joys and sorrows, cried I, why
could not a man sit down in the lap of content
here——and dance, and sing, and say his prayers, and go
to heaven with this nut-brown maid? Capriciously did she bend her
head on one side, and dance up insidious——Then
’tis time to dance off, quoth I; so changing only partners
and tunes, I danced it away from <i>Lunel</i> to
<i>Montpellier</i>——from thence to <i>Pesçnas,
Beziers</i>——I danced it along through <i>Narbonne,
Carcasson</i>, and <i>Castle Naudairy</i>, till at last I danced
myself into <i>Perdrillo</i>’s pavillion, where pulling out a
paper of black lines, that I might go on straight forwards, without
digression or parenthesis, in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
amours——</p>

<p>I begun thus——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

<p>
——B<small>UT</small> softly——for in these sportive
plains, and under this genial sun, where at this instant all flesh is running
out piping, fiddling, and dancing to the vintage, and every step that’s
taken, the judgment is surprised by the imagination, I defy, notwithstanding
all that has been said upon <i>straight lines</i><a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37" id="linknoteref-37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> in sundry pages
of my book—I defy the best cabbage planter that ever existed, whether he
plants backwards or forwards, it makes little difference in the account (except
that he will have more to answer for in the one case than in the other)—I
defy him to go on coolly, critically, and canonically, planting his cabbages
one by one, in straight lines, and stoical distances, especially if slits in
petticoats are unsew’d up—without ever and anon straddling out, or
sidling into some bastardly digression——In <i>Freeze-land,
Fog-land</i>, and some other lands I wot of—it may be done——
</p>

<p>But in this clear climate of fantasy and perspiration, where
every idea, sensible and insensible, gets vent—in this land,
my dear <i>Eugenius</i>—in this fertile land of chivalry and
romance, where I now sit, unskrewing my ink-horn to write my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s amours, and with all the meanders of
J<small>ULIA</small>’s track in quest of her
D<small>IEGO</small>, in full view of my study window—if thou
comest not and takest me by the hand——</p>

<p>What a work it is likely to turn out!</p>

<p>I<small>T</small> is with <small>LOVE</small> as
with <small>CUCKOLDOM</small>——</p>

<p>But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a
thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not
imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live
(whereas the <small>COMPARISON</small> may be imparted to him any
hour in the day)——I’ll just mention it, and begin
in good earnest.</p>

<p>The thing is this.</p>

<p>That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now
in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way
of doing it is the best——I’m sure it is the most
religious——for I begin with writing the first
sentence——and trusting to Almighty God for the
second.</p>

<p>’Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of
opening his street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and kinsfolk, with the devil and all his
imps, with their hammers and engines, &amp;c. only to observe how
one sentence of mine follows another, and how the plan follows the
whole.</p>

<p>I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what
confidence, as I grasp the elbow of it, I look
up——catching the idea, even sometimes before it half
way reaches me——</p>

<p>I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which
heaven intended for another man.</p>

<p>——Bon jour!——good
morrow!——so you have got your cloak on
betimes!——but ’tis a cold morning, and you judge
the matter rightly——’tis better to be well
mounted, than go o’ foot——and obstructions in the
glands are dangerous——And how goes it with thy
concubine—thy wife,—and thy little ones o’ both
sides? and when did you hear from the old gentleman and
lady—your sister, aunt, uncle, and cousins——I
hope they have got better of their colds, coughs, claps,
tooth-aches, fevers, stranguries, sciaticas, swellings, and sore
eyes.</p>

<p>
——What a devil of an apothecary! to take so much blood—give
such a vile
purge—puke—poultice—plaister—night-draught—clyster—blister?——And
why so many grains of calomel? santa Maria! and such a dose of opium!
periclitating, pardi! the whole family of ye, from head to tail——By
my great-aunt <i>Dinah</i>’s old black velvet mask! I think there is no
occasion for it.
</p>

<p>Now this being a little bald about the chin, by frequently
putting off and on, <i>before</i> she was got with child by the
coachman—not one of our family would wear it after. To cover
the <small>MASK</small> afresh, was more than the mask was
worth——and to wear a mask which was bald, or which
could be half seen through, was as bad as having no mask at
all——</p>

<p>This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that in all
our numerous family, for these four generations, we count no more
than one archbishop, a <i>Welch</i> judge, some three or four
aldermen, and a single mountebank——</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, we boast of no less than a dozen
alchymists.</p>

<p>“I<small>T</small> is with Love as with
Cuckoldom”——the suffering party is at least the
<i>third</i>, but generally the last in the house who knows any
thing about the matter: this comes, as all the world knows, from
having half a dozen words for one thing; and so long, as what in
this vessel of the human frame, is <i>Love</i>—may be
<i>Hatred</i>, in that——<i>Sentiment</i> half a yard
higher——and <i>Nonsense</i>———no,
Madam,—not there——I mean at the part I am now
pointing to with my forefinger——how can we help
ourselves?</p>

<p>Of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was the
worst fitted, to have push’d his researches, thro’ such
a contention of feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run
on, as we do worse matters, to see what they would turn
out——had not <i>Bridget</i>’s pre-notification of
them to <i>Susannah</i>, and <i>Susannah</i>’s
repeated manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary
for my uncle <i>Toby</i> to look into the affair.</p>

<p>W<small>HY</small> weavers, gardeners, and
gladiators—or a man with a pined leg (proceeding from some
ailment in the <i>foot</i>)—should ever have had some tender
nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well and
duly settled and accounted for, by ancient and modern
physiologists.</p>

<p>A water-drinker, provided he is a profess’d one, and does
it without fraud or covin, is precisely in the same predicament:
not that, at first sight, there is any consequence, or show of
logic in it, “That a rill of cold water dribbling
through my inward parts, should light up a torch in my
<i>Jenny</i>’s—”</p>

<p>——The proposition does not strike one; on the
contrary, it seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and
effects——</p>

<p>But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason.</p>

<p>——“And in perfect good health with
it?”</p>

<p>—The most perfect,—Madam, that friendship herself
could wish me——</p>

<p>
“And drink nothing!—nothing but water?”
</p>

<p>—Impetuous fluid! the moment thou pressest against the
flood-gates of the brain——see how they give
way!——</p>

<p>In swims C<small>URIOSITY</small>, beckoning to her damsels to
follow—they dive into the center of the
current——</p>

<p>F<small>ANCY</small> sits musing upon the bank, and with her
eyes following the stream, turns straws and bulrushes into masts
and bow-sprits——And D<small>ESIRE</small>, with vest
held up to the knee in one hand, snatches at them, as they swim by
her, with the other——</p>

<p>O ye water drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that
ye have so often governed and turn’d this world about like a mill-wheel—grinding the faces of the
impotent—bepowdering their ribs—bepeppering their
noses, and changing sometimes even the very frame and face of
nature——</p>

<p>If I was you, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, I would drink more water,

<p>For my own part, I am resolved never to read any book but my
own, as long as I live.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXX</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>WISH</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> had been
a water-drinker; for then the thing had been accounted for, That
the first moment Widow <i>Wadman</i> saw him, she felt something
stirring within her in his
favour—Something!—something.</p>

<p>—Something perhaps more than friendship—less than
love—something—no matter what—no matter
where—I would not give a single hair off my mule’s tail, and
be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain has not many
to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to be let
by your worships into the secret——</p>

<p>But the truth is, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was not a water-drinker;
he drank it neither pure nor mix’d, or any how, or any where,
except fortuitously upon some advanced posts, where better liquor
was not to be had——or during the time he was under
cure; when the surgeon telling him it would extend the fibres, and
bring them sooner into contact——my uncle <i>Toby</i>
drank it for quietness sake.</p>

<p>Now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be
produced without a cause, and as it is as well known, that my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was neither a weaver—a gardener, or a
gladiator——unless as a captain, you will needs have him
one—but then he was only a captain of foot—and besides,
the whole is an equivocation——There is nothing left for
us to suppose, but that my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
leg——but that will avail us little in the present
hypothesis, unless it had proceeded from some ailment <i>in the
foot</i>—whereas his leg was not emaciated from any disorder
in his foot—for my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s leg was not
emaciated at all. It was a little stiff and awkward, from a total
disuse of it, for the three years he lay confined at my
father’s house in town; but it was plump and muscular, and in
all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other.</p>

<p>I declare, I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my
life, where my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet,
and torture the chapter I had been writing, to the service of the
chapter following it, than in the present case: one would think I
took a pleasure in running into difficulties of this kind, merely
to make fresh experiments of getting out of
’em——Inconsiderate soul that thou art! What! are
not the unavoidable distresses with which, as an author and a man,
thou art hemm’d in on every side of thee——are
they, <i>Tristram</i>, not sufficient, but thou must entangle thyself still
more?</p>

<p>
Is it not enough that thou art in debt, and that thou hast ten cart-loads of
thy fifth and sixth volumes<a href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> still—still unsold, and art
almost at thy wit’s ends, how to get them off thy hands?
</p>

<p>To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that
thou gattest in skating against the wind in <i>Flanders?</i> and is
it but two months ago, that in a fit of laughter, on seeing a
cardinal make water like a quirister (with both hands) thou brakest
a vessel in thy lungs, whereby, in two hours, thou lost as many
quarts of blood; and hadst thou lost as much more, did not the
faculty tell thee——it would have amounted to a
gallon?——</p>

<p>—But for heaven’s sake, let us not talk of quarts or
gallons——let us take the story straight before us; it
is so nice and intricate a one, it will scarce bear the
transposition of a single tittle; and, somehow or other, you have

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal
had posted down with so much heat and precipitation, to take
possession of the spot of ground we have so often spoke of, in
order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the allies;
that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair, it was neither a pioneer’s spade, a pickax, or
a shovel—</p>

<p>—It was a bed to lie on: so that as <i>Shandy-Hall</i> was
at that time unfurnished; and the little inn where poor <i>Le
Fever</i> died, not yet built; my uncle <i>Toby</i> was constrained
to accept of a bed at Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s, for a night or
two, till corporal <i>Trim</i> (who to the character of an
excellent valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer,
superadded that of an excellent upholsterer too), with
the help of a carpenter and a couple of taylors, constructed one in
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s house.</p>

<p>A daughter of <i>Eve</i>, for such was widow <i>Wadman</i>, and
’tis all the character I intend to give of her—</p>

<p>—“<i>&nbsp;That she was a perfect
woman—</i>” had better be fifty leagues off—or in
her warm bed—or playing with a case-knife—or any thing
you please—than make a man the object of her attention, when
the house and all the furniture is her own.</p>

<p>There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light,
where a woman has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in
more lights than one—but here, for her soul, she can see him
in no light without mixing something of her own goods and chattels
along with him——till by reiterated acts of such
combination, he gets foisted into her inventory——</p>

<p>—And then good night.</p>

<p>But this is not matter of S<small>YSTEM</small>; for I have
delivered that above——nor is it matter of
B<small>REVIARY</small>——for I make no man’s
creed but my own——nor matter of
F<small>ACT</small>——at least that I know of; but
’tis matter copulative and introductory to what follows.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>DO</small> not speak it with regard to the
coarseness or cleanness of them—or the strength of their
gussets——but pray do not night-shifts differ from
day-shifts as much in this particular, as in any thing else in the
world; that they so far exceed the others in length, that when you
are laid down in them, they fall almost as much below the feet, as
the day-shifts fall short of them?</p>

<p>Widow <i>Wadman</i>’s night-shifts (as was the mode I
suppose in King <i>William</i>’s and Queen
<i>Anne</i>’s reigns) were cut however after this fashion;
and if the fashion is changed (for in <i>Italy</i> they are come to
nothing)——so much the worse for the public; they were two <i>Flemish</i> ells
and a half in length, so that allowing a moderate woman two ells,
she had half an ell to spare, to do what she would with.</p>

<p>Now from one little indulgence gained after another, in the many
bleak and decemberley nights of a seven years widow-hood, things
had insensibly come to this pass, and for the two last years had
got establish’d into one of the ordinances of the
bed-chamber—That as soon as Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> was put to
bed, and had got her legs stretched down to the bottom of it, of
which she always gave <i>Bridget</i> notice—<i>Bridget</i>,
with all suitable decorum, having first open’d the
bed-clothes at the feet, took hold of the half-ell of cloth we are
speaking of, and having gently, and with both her hands, drawn it
downwards to its furthest extension, and then contracted it again
side-long by four or five even plaits, she took a large corking-pin
out of her sleeve, and with the point directed towards her,
pinn’d the plaits all fast together a little above the hem; which done, she tuck’d all in tight at
the feet, and wish’d her mistress a good night.</p>

<p>This was constant, and without any other variation than this;
that on shivering and tempestuous nights, when <i>Bridget</i>
untuck’d the feet of the bed, &amp;c. to do
this——she consulted no thermometer but that of her own
passions; and so performed it standing—kneeling—or
squatting, according to the different degrees of faith, hope, and
charity, she was in, and bore towards her mistress that night. In
every other respect, the <i>etiquette</i> was sacred, and might
have vied with the most mechanical one of the most inflexible
bed-chamber in <i>Christendom.</i></p>

<p>The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle
<i>Toby</i> up stairs, which was about ten——Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> threw herself into her arm-chair, and crossing her
left knee with her right, which formed a resting-place for her
elbow, she reclin’d her cheek upon the palm of her hand, and
leaning forwards, ruminated till midnight upon both sides of
the question.</p>

<p>The second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered
<i>Bridget</i> to bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave
them upon the table, she took out her marriage-settlement, and read
it over with great devotion: and the third night (which was the
last of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s stay) when <i>Bridget</i> had
pull’d down the night-shift, and was assaying to stick in the
corking pin——</p>

<p>——With a kick of both heels at once, but at the same
time the most natural kick that could be kick’d in her
situation——for supposing * * * * * * * * * to be the
sun in its meridian, it was a north-east kick——she
kick’d the pin out of her fingers——the
<i>etiquette</i> which hung upon it, down——down it fell
to the ground, and was shiver’d into a thousand atoms.</p>

<p>From all which it was plain that widow <i>Wadman</i> was in love
with my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i>’s head at
that time was full of other matters, so that it was not till the
demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>, when all the other civilities of
<i>Europe</i> were settled, that he found leisure to return
this.</p>

<p>This made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my
uncle <i>Toby</i>—but with respect to Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, a
vacancy)—of almost eleven years. But in all cases of this
nature, as it is the second blow, happen at what distance of time
it will, which makes the fray——I chuse for that reason
to call these the amours of my uncle <i>Toby</i> with Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>, rather than the amours of Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> with my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>This is not a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>It is not like the affair of <i>an old hat
cock’d——and a cock’d old hat</i>, about
which your reverences have so often been at odds with one another——but there
is a difference here in the nature of things——</p>

<p>And let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXV</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> as widow <i>Wadman</i> did love
my uncle <i>Toby</i>——and my uncle <i>Toby</i> did not
love widow <i>Wadman</i>, there was nothing for widow <i>Wadman</i>
to do, but to go on and love my uncle <i>Toby</i>——or
let it alone.</p>

<p>Widow <i>Wadman</i> would do neither the one or the other.</p>

<p>——Gracious heaven!——but I forget I am a
little of her temper myself; for whenever it so falls out, which it
sometimes does about the equinoxes, that an earthly goddess is so
much this, and that, and t’other, that I cannot eat my
breakfast for her——and that she careth not three
halfpence whether I eat my breakfast or no——</p>

<p>——Curse on her! and so I send her to <i>Tartary</i>,
and from <i>Tartary</i> to <i>Terra del Fuogo</i>, and so on to the
devil: in short, there is not an infernal nitch where I do not take
her divinityship and stick it.</p>

<p>But as the heart is tender, and the passions in these tides ebb
and flow ten times in a minute, I instantly bring her back again;
and as I do all things in extremes, I place her in the very center
of the milky-way——</p>

<p>Brightest of stars! thou wilt shed thy influence upon some
one——</p>

<p>——The duce take her and her influence
too——for at that word I lose all
patience——much good may it do him!——By all
that is hirsute and gashly! I cry, taking off my furr’d cap,
and twisting it round my finger——I would not give
sixpence for a dozen such!</p>

<p>——But ’tis an excellent cap too (putting it
upon my head, and pressing it close to my ears)—and
warm—and soft; especially if you stroke it the right
way—but alas! that will never be my
luck——(so here my philosophy is shipwreck’d
again.)</p>

<p>——No; I shall never have a finger in the pye (so
here I break my metaphor)——</p>

<p>Crust and Crumb</p>

<p>Inside and out</p>

<p>Top and bottom——I detest it, I hate it, I repudiate
it——I’m sick at the sight of it——</p>

<p>’Tis all pepper,<br>
     garlick,<br>
     speak-punctuation:,<br>
     salt, and<br>
     devil’s dung——by
the great arch-cooks of cooks, who does nothing, I think, from
morning to night, but sit down by the fire-side and invent
inflammatory dishes for us, I would not touch it for the
world——</p>

<p>——<i>O Tristram! Tristram!</i> cried
<i>Jenny.</i></p>

<p><i>O Jenny! Jenny!</i> replied I, and so went on
with the thirty-sixth chapter.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

<p>——“Not touch it for the world,”
did I say——</p>

<p>Lord, how I have heated my imagination with this metaphor!</p>

<p>W<small>HICH</small> shews, let your reverences and
worships say what you will of it (for as for
<i>thinking</i>——all who do think—think pretty
much alike both upon it and other matters)——Love is
certainly, at least alphabetically speaking, one of the most</p>

<p><b>R</b>&nbsp;idiculous—though by the bye the R should

my father once told my uncle <i>Toby</i> upon the close of a long
dissertation upon the subject——“You can
scarce,” said he, “combine two ideas together upon it,
brother <i>Toby</i>, without an
hypallage”——What’s that? cried my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>The cart before the horse, replied my father——</p>

<p>——And what is he to do there? cried my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>Nothing, quoth my father, but to get in——or let it
alone.</p>

<p>Now widow <i>Wadman</i>, as I told you before, would do neither
the one or the other.</p>

<p>She stood however ready harnessed and caparisoned at all points,
to watch accidents.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> Fates, who certainly all
fore-knew of these amours of widow <i>Wadman</i> and my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, had, from the first creation of matter and motion (and
with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind),
established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to
one another, that it was scarce possible for my uncle <i>Toby</i>
to have dwelt in any other house in the world, or to have occupied
any other garden in <i>Christendom</i>, but the very house and
garden which join’d and laid parallel to Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s; this, with the advantage of a thickset
arbour in Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s garden, but planted in the
hedge-row of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s, put all the occasions
into her hands which Love-militancy wanted; she could observe my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s motions, and
was mistress likewise of his councils of war; and as his
unsuspecting heart had given leave to the corporal, through the
mediation of <i>Bridget</i>, to make her a wicker-gate of
communication to enlarge her walks, it enabled her to carry on her
approaches to the very door of the sentry-box; and sometimes out of
gratitude, to make an attack, and endeavour to blow my uncle
<i>Toby</i> up in the very sentry-box itself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is a great pity——but
’tis certain from every day’s observation of man, that
he may be set on fire like a candle, at either end—provided
there is a sufficient wick standing out; if there is
not—there’s an end of the affair; and if there
is—by lighting it at the bottom, as the flame in that case
has the misfortune generally to put out itself—there’s
an end of the affair again.</p>

<p>For my part, could I always have the ordering of it which way I
would be burnt myself—for I cannot bear the thoughts of being
burnt like a beast—I would oblige a housewife constantly to
light me at the top; for then I should burn down decently to the
socket; that is, from my head to my heart, from my heart to my
liver, from my liver to my bowels, and so on by the meseraick veins
and arteries, through all the turns and lateral insertions of the
intestines and their tunicles to the blind gut——</p>

<p>——I beseech you, doctor <i>Slop</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, interrupting him as he mentioned the <i>blind gut</i>,
in a discourse with my father the night my mother was brought to
bed of me——I beseech you, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
to tell me which is the blind gut; for, old as I am, I vow I do not
know to this day where it lies.</p>

<p>The blind gut, answered doctor <i>Slop</i>, lies betwixt the
<i>Ilion</i> and <i>Colon</i>——</p>

<p>In a man? said my father.</p>

<p>——’Tis precisely the same, cried
doctor <i>Slop</i>, in a woman.——</p>

<p>That’s more than I know; quoth my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XL</small>
</h3>

<p>——And so to make sure of both systems, Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> predetermined to light my uncle <i>Toby</i> neither
at this end or that; but, like a prodigal’s candle, to light
him, if possible, at both ends at once.</p>

<p>Now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture,
including both of horse and foot, from the great arsenal of
<i>Venice</i> to the <i>Tower</i> of <i>London</i> (exclusive), if
Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had been rummaging for seven years together, and
with <i>Bridget</i> to help her, she could not have found any one
<i>blind</i> or <i>mantelet</i> so fit for her purpose, as that
which the expediency of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s affairs had
fix’d up ready to her hands.</p>

<p>I believe I have not told you——but I don’t
know——possibly I have——be it as it will, ’tis one of the number of those
many things, which a man had better do over again, than dispute
about it—That whatever town or fortress the corporal was at
work upon, during the course of their campaign, my uncle
<i>Toby</i> always took care, on the inside of his sentry-box,
which was towards his left hand, to have a plan of the place,
fasten’d up with two or three pins at the top, but loose at
the bottom, for the conveniency of holding it up to the eye,
&amp;c.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as occasions required; so that
when an attack was resolved upon, Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had nothing
more to do, when she had got advanced to the door of the
sentry-box, but to extend her right hand; and edging in her left
foot at the same movement, to take hold of the map or plan, or
upright, or whatever it was, and with out-stretched neck meeting it
half way,—to advance it towards her; on which my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s passions were sure to catch
fire——for he would instantly take hold of the other
corner of the map in his left hand, and with the end of his pipe in the other, begin an explanation.</p>

<p>When the attack was advanced to this point;——the
world will naturally enter into the reasons of Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s next stroke of generalship——which
was, to take my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s tobacco-pipe out of his
hand as soon as she possibly could; which, under one pretence or
other, but generally that of pointing more distinctly at some
redoubt or breastwork in the map, she would effect before my uncle
<i>Toby</i> (poor soul!) had well march’d above half a dozen
toises with it.</p>

<p>—It obliged my uncle <i>Toby</i> to make use of his
forefinger.</p>

<p>The difference it made in the attack was this; That in going
upon it, as in the first case, with the end of her fore-finger
against the end of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s tobacco-pipe, she
might have travelled with it, along the lines, from <i>Dan</i> to
<i>Beersheba</i>, had my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s lines
reach’d so far, without any effect: For as there was no
arterial or vital heat in the end of the tobacco-pipe, it could
excite no sentiment——it could neither give fire by
pulsation——or receive it by
sympathy——’twas nothing but smoke.</p>

<p>Whereas, in following my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s forefinger
with hers, close thro’ all the little turns and indentings of
his works——pressing sometimes against the side of
it——then treading upon its nail——then
tripping it up——then touching it here——then
there, and so on——it set something at least in
motion.</p>

<p>This, tho’ slight skirmishing, and at a distance from the
main body, yet drew on the rest; for here, the map usually falling
with the back of it, close to the side of the sentry-box, my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, in the simplicity of his soul, would lay his hand flat
upon it, in order to go on with his explanation; and Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>, by a manœuvre as quick as thought, would as
certainly place her’s close beside it; this at once opened a
communication, large enough for any sentiment to pass or re-pass,
which a person skill’d in the elementary and practical part of love-making, has
occasion for——</p>

<p>By bringing up her forefinger parallel (as before) to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s——it unavoidably brought the thumb
into action——and the forefinger and thumb being once
engaged, as naturally brought in the whole hand. Thine, dear uncle
<i>Toby!</i> was never now in ’ts right
place——Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had it ever to take up, or,
with the gentlest pushings, protrusions, and equivocal
compressions, that a hand to be removed is capable of
receiving——to get it press’d a hair breadth of
one side out of her way.</p>

<p>Whilst this was doing, how could she forget to make him
sensible, that it was her leg (and no one’s else) at the
bottom of the sentry-box, which slightly press’d against the
calf of his——So that my uncle <i>Toby</i> being thus
attack’d and sore push’d on both his
wings——was it a wonder, if now and then, it put his
centre into disorder?——</p>

<p>——The duce take it! said my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HESE</small> attacks of Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>,
you will readily conceive to be of different kinds; varying from
each other, like the attacks which history is full of, and from the
same reasons. A general looker-on would scarce allow them to be
attacks at all——or if he did, would confound them all
together——but I write not to them: it will be time
enough to be a little more exact in my descriptions of them, as I
come up to them, which will not be for some chapters; having
nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of original
papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up by
themselves, there is a plan of <i>Bouchain</i> in perfect
preservation (and shall be kept so, whilst I have power to preserve
any thing), upon the lower corner of which, on the right hand
side, there is still remaining the marks of a snuffy
finger and thumb, which there is all the reason in the world to
imagine, were Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s; for the opposite side of
the margin, which I suppose to have been my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s, is absolutely clean: This seems an
authenticated record of one of these attacks; for there are
vestigia of the two punctures partly grown up, but still visible on
the opposite corner of the map, which are unquestionably the very
holes, through which it has been pricked up in the
sentry-box——</p>

<p>By all that is priestly! I value this precious relick, with its
<i>stigmata</i> and pricks, more than all the relicks of the
<i>Romish</i> church——always excepting, when I am
writing upon these matters, the pricks which entered the flesh of
St. <i>Radagunda</i> in the desert, which in your road from
F<small>ESSE</small> to C<small>LUNY</small>, the nuns of that name
will shew you for love.</p>

<h3>

<p>I <small>THINK</small>, an’ please your
honour, quoth <i>Trim</i>, the fortifications are quite
destroyed——and the bason is upon a level with the
mole——I think so too; replied my uncle <i>Toby</i> with
a sigh half suppress’d——but step into the
parlour, <i>Trim</i>, for the stipulation——it lies upon
the table.</p>

<p>It has lain there these six weeks, replied the corporal, till
this very morning that the old woman kindled the fire with
it—</p>

<p>——Then, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, there is no
further occasion for our services. The more, an’ please your
honour, the pity, said the corporal; in uttering which he cast his
spade into the wheel-barrow, which was beside him, with an air the
most expressive of disconsolation that can be imagined, and was
heavily turning about to look for his pickax, his pioneer’s
shovel, his picquets, and other little military stores, in order to
carry them off the field——when a heigh-ho! from the
sentry-box, which being made of thin slit deal, reverberated the
sound more sorrowfully to his ear, forbad him.</p>

<p>——No; said the corporal to himself, I’ll do it
before his honour rises to-morrow morning; so taking his spade out
of the wheel-barrow again, with a little earth in it, as if to
level something at the foot of the glacis——but with a
real intent to approach nearer to his master, in order to divert
him——he loosen’d a sod or two——pared
their edges with his spade, and having given them a gentle blow or
two with the back of it, he sat himself down close by my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s feet and began as follows.</p>

<p>I<small>T</small> was a thousand

<p>A soldier, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, interrupting the
corporal, is no more exempt from saying a foolish thing, <i>Trim</i>, than a man
of letters——But not so often, an’ please your
honour, replied the corporal——my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave
a nod.</p>

<p>It was a thousand pities then, said the corporal, casting his
eye upon <i>Dunkirk</i>, and the mole, as <i>Servius Sulpicius</i>,
in returning out of <i>Asia</i> (when he sailed from
<i>Ægina</i> towards <i>Megara</i>), did upon <i>Corinth</i>
and <i>Pyreus</i>——</p>

<p>—“It was a thousand pities, an’ please
your honour, to destroy these works——and a thousand
pities to have let them stood.”——</p>

<p>——Thou art right, <i>Trim</i>, in both cases; said
my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——This, continued the corporal, is
the reason, that from the beginning of their demolition to the
end——I have never once whistled, or sung, or
laugh’d, or cry’d, or talk’d of past done deeds,
or told your honour one story good or bad——</p>

<p>——Thou hast many excellencies, <i>Trim</i>, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, and I hold it not the least of them, as thou
happenest to be a story-teller, that of the number thou hast told me, either to amuse me in my
painful hours, or divert me in my grave ones—thou hast seldom
told me a bad one——</p>

<p>——Because, an’ please your honour, except one
of a <i>King of Bohemia and his seven castles</i>,—they are
all true; for they are about myself——</p>

<p>I do not like the subject the worse, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, on that score: But prithee what is this story? thou
hast excited my curiosity.</p>

<p>I’ll tell it your honour, quoth the corporal,
directly—Provided, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking
earnestly towards <i>Dunkirk</i> and the mole
again——provided it is not a merry one; to such,
<i>Trim</i>, a man should ever bring one half of the entertainment
along with him; and the disposition I am in at present would wrong
both thee, <i>Trim</i>, and thy story——It is not a
merry one by any means, replied the corporal—Nor would I have
it altogether a grave one, added my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——It is neither the one nor the other,
replied the corporal, but will suit your honour exactly——Then I’ll
thank thee for it with all my heart, cried my uncle <i>Toby;</i> so
prithee begin it, <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>The corporal made his reverence; and though it is not so easy a
matter as the world imagines, to pull off a lank <i>Montero</i>-cap
with grace——or a whit less difficult, in my
conceptions, when a man is sitting squat upon the ground, to make a
bow so teeming with respect as the corporal was wont; yet by
suffering the palm of his right hand, which was towards his master,
to slip backwards upon the grass, a little beyond his body, in
order to allow it the greater sweep——and by an unforced
compression, at the same time, of his cap with the thumb and the
two forefingers of his left, by which the diameter of the cap
became reduced, so that it might be said, rather to be insensibly
squeez’d—than pull’d off with a
flatus——the corporal acquitted himself of both in a
better manner than the posture of his affairs promised; and having
hemmed twice, to find in what key his story would best go, and best
suit his master’s humour,—he exchanged a single
look of kindness with him, and set off thus.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>THE STORY OF THE<br>
KING OF BOHEMIA AND<br>
HIS SEVEN CASTLES</small>
</p>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> was a certain king of Bo - -
he——</p>

<p>As the corporal was entering the confines of <i>Bohemia</i>, my
uncle <i>Toby</i> obliged him to halt for a single moment; he had
set out bare-headed, having, since he pull’d off his
<i>Montero</i>-cap in the latter end of the last chapter, left it
lying beside him on the ground.</p>

<p>——The eye of Goodness espieth all
things——so that before the corporal had well got
through the first five words of his story, had my uncle <i>Toby</i>
twice touch’d his <i>Montero</i>-cap with the end of his
cane, interrogatively——as much as to say, Why
don’t you put it on, <i>Trim? Trim</i> took it up with
the most respectful slowness, and casting a glance of humiliation as he did it, upon the embroidery of the
fore-part, which being dismally tarnish’d and fray’d
moreover in some of the principal leaves and boldest parts of the
pattern, he lay’d it down again between his two feet, in
order to moralize upon the subject.</p>

<p>——’Tis every word of it but too true, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, that thou art about to observe——</p>

<p>“<i>Nothing in this world, Trim, is made to last for
ever.</i>”</p>

<p>——But when tokens, dear <i>Tom</i>, of thy love and
remembrance wear out, said <i>Trim</i>, what shall we say?</p>

<p>There is no occasion, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
to say any thing else; and was a man to puzzle his brains till
Doom’s day, I believe, <i>Trim</i>, it would be
impossible.</p>

<p>The corporal, perceiving my uncle <i>Toby</i> was in the right,
and that it would be in vain for the wit of man to think of
extracting a purer moral from his cap, without further attempting
it, he put it on; and passing his hand across his forehead to rub
out a pensive wrinkle, which the text and the doctrine between them
had engender’d, he return’d, with the same look and
tone of voice, to his story of the king of <i>Bohemia</i> and his
seven castles.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>THE STORY OF THE<br>
KING OF BOHEMIA AND<br>

</p>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> was a certain king of
<i>Bohemia</i>, but in whose reign, except his own, I am not able
to inform your honour——</p>

<p>I do not desire it of thee, <i>Trim</i>, by any means, cried my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>——It was a little before the time, an’ please
your honour, when giants were beginning to leave off
breeding:—but in what year of our Lord that was—</p>

<p>I would not give a halfpenny to know, said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>——Only, an’ please your honour, it makes a
story look the better in the face——</p>

<p>——’Tis thy own, <i>Trim</i>, so ornament it
after thy own fashion; and take any date, continued my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, looking pleasantly upon him—take any date in the
whole world thou chusest, and put it to—thou art heartily
welcome——</p>

<p>The corporal bowed; for of every century, and of every year of
that century, from the first creation of the world down to
<i>Noah</i>’s flood; and from <i>Noah</i>’s flood to
the birth of <i>Abraham;</i> through all the pilgrimages of the
patriarchs, to the departure of the <i>Israelites</i> out of
<i>Egypt</i>——and throughout all the Dynasties,
Olympiads, Urbeconditas, and other memorable epochas of the
different nations of the world, down to the coming of Christ, and
from thence to the very moment in which the corporal was telling
his story——had my uncle <i>Toby</i> subjected this vast
empire of time and all its abysses at his feet; but as <small>MODESTY</small> scarce touches with a
finger what <small>LIBERALITY</small> offers her with both hands
open—the corporal contented himself with the very <i>worst
year</i> of the whole bunch; which, to prevent your honours of the
Majority and Minority from tearing the very flesh off your bones in
contestation, ‘&nbsp;Whether that year is not always the last
cast-year of the last cast-almanack’——I tell you
plainly it was; but from a different reason than you wot
of——</p>

<p>——It was the year next him——which being
the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and twelve, when the Duke of
<i>Ormond</i> was playing the devil in
<i>Flanders</i>——the corporal took it, and set out with
it afresh on his expedition to <i>Bohemia.</i></p>

</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and twelve, there was, an’ please your
honour——</p>

<p>—To tell thee truly, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, any other date would have pleased me much better, not
only on account of the sad stain upon our history that year, in
marching off our troops, and refusing to cover the siege of
<i>Quesnoi</i>, though <i>Fagel</i> was carrying on the works with
such incredible vigour—but likewise on the score,
<i>Trim</i>, of thy own story; because if there are—and
which, from what thou hast dropt, I partly suspect to be the
fact—if there are giants in it——</p>

<p>There is but one, an’ please your honour——</p>

<p>——’Tis as bad as twenty, replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——thou should’st have carried him back
some seven or eight hundred years out of harm’s way, both of
critics and other people: and therefore I would advise thee, if
ever thou tellest it again——</p>

<p>——If I live, an’ please your honour, but once
to get through it, I will never tell it again, quoth <i>Trim</i>,
either to man, woman, or child——Poo—poo! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>—but with accents of
such sweet encouragement did he utter it, that the corporal went on
with his story with more alacrity than ever.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>THE STORY OF THE<br>
KING OF BOHEMIA AND<br>
HIS SEVEN CASTLES,<br>
CONTINUED</small>
</p>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> was, an’ please your
honour, said the corporal, raising his voice and rubbing the palms
of his two hands cheerily together as he begun, a certain king of
<i>Bohemia</i>——</p>

<p>——Leave out the date entirely, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, leaning forwards, and laying his hand gently
upon the corporal’s shoulder to temper the
interruption—leave it out entirely, <i>Trim;</i> a story
passes very well without these niceties, unless one is pretty sure
of ’em——Sure of ’em! said the corporal,
shaking his head——</p>

<p>Right; answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, it is not easy,
<i>Trim</i>, for one, bred up as thou and I have been to arms, who
seldom looks further forward than to the end of his
musket, or backwards beyond his knapsack, to know much about this
matter——God bless your honour! said the corporal, won
by the manner of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s reasoning, as much as
by the reasoning itself, he has something else to do; if not on
action, or a march, or upon duty in his garrison—he has his
firelock, an’ please your honour, to furbish—his
accoutrements to take care of—his regimentals to
mend—himself to shave and keep clean, so as to appear always
like what he is upon the parade; what business, added the corporal
triumphantly, has a soldier, an’ please your honour, to know
any thing at all of <i>geography?</i></p>

<p>——Thou would’st have said <i>chronology,
Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby;</i> for as for geography,
’tis of absolute use to him; he must be acquainted intimately
with every country and its boundaries where his profession carries
him; he should know every town and city, and village and hamlet,
with the canals, the roads, and hollow ways which lead up to them; there
is not a river or a rivulet he passes, <i>Trim</i>, but he should
be able at first sight to tell thee what is its name—in what
mountains it takes its rise—what is its course—how far
it is navigable—where fordable—where not; he should
know the fertility of every valley, as well as the hind who ploughs
it; and be able to describe, or, if it is required, to give thee an
exact map of all the plains and defiles, the forts, the
acclivities, the woods and morasses, thro’ and by which his
army is to march; he should know their produce, their plants, their
minerals, their waters, their animals, their seasons, their
climates, their heats and cold, their inhabitants, their customs,
their language, their policy, and even their religion.</p>

<p>Is it else to be conceived, corporal, continued my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, rising up in his sentry-box, as he began to warm in
this part of his discourse—how <i>Marlborough</i> could have
marched his army from the banks of the <i>Maes</i> to
<i>Belburg;</i> from <i>Belburg</i> to <i>Kerpenord</i>—(here the
corporal could sit no longer) from <i>Kerpenord, Trim</i>, to
<i>Kalsaken;</i> from <i>Kalsaken</i> to <i>Newdorf;</i> from
<i>Newdorf</i> to <i>Landenbourg;</i> from <i>Landenbourg</i> to
<i>Mildenheim;</i> from <i>Mildenheim</i> to <i>Elchingen;</i> from
<i>Elchingen</i> to <i>Gingen;</i> from <i>Gingen</i> to
<i>Balmerchoffen;</i> from <i>Balmerchoffen</i> to
<i>Skellenburg</i>, where he broke in upon the enemy’s works;
forced his passage over the <i>Danube;</i> cross’d the
<i>Lech</i>—push’d on his troops into the heart of the
empire, marching at the head of them through <i>Fribourg,
Hokenwert</i>, and <i>Schonevelt</i>, to the plains of
<i>Blenheim</i> and <i>Hochstet?</i>——Great as he
was, corporal, he could not have advanced a step, or made one
single day’s march without the aids of
<i>Geography.</i>——As for <i>Chronology</i>, I own,
<i>Trim</i>, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, sitting down again
coolly in his sentry-box, that of all others, it seems a science
which the soldier might best spare, was it not for the lights which
that science must one day give him, in determining the invention of
powder; the furious execution of which, renversing every thing like thunder before
it, has become a new æra to us of military improvements,
changing so totally the nature of attacks and defences both by sea
and land, and awakening so much art and skill in doing it, that the
world cannot be too exact in ascertaining the precise time of its
discovery, or too inquisitive in knowing what great man was the
discoverer, and what occasions gave birth to it.</p>

<p>I am far from controverting, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
what historians agree in, that in the year of our Lord 1380, under
the reign of <i>Wencelaus</i>, son of <i>Charles</i> the
Fourth——a certain priest, whose name was
<i>Schwartz</i>, shew’d the use of powder to the
<i>Venetians</i>, in their wars against the <i>Genoese;</i> but
’tis certain he was not the first; because if we are to
believe Don <i>Pedro</i>, the bishop of <i>Leon</i>—How came
priests and bishops, an’ please your honour, to trouble their
heads so much about gun-powder? God knows, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——his providence brings good out of every
thing—and he avers, in his chronicle of King
<i>Alphonsus</i>, who reduced <i>Toledo</i>, That in the year 1343,
which was full thirty-seven years before that time, the secret of
powder was well known, and employed with success, both by Moors and
Christians, not only in their sea-combats, at that period, but in
many of their most memorable sieges in <i>Spain</i> and
<i>Barbary</i>—And all the world knows, that Friar
<i>Bacon</i> had wrote expressly about it, and had generously given
the world a receipt to make it by, above a hundred and fifty years
before even <i>Schwartz</i> was born—And that the
<i>Chinese</i>, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, embarrass us, and all
accounts of it, still more, by boasting of the invention some
hundreds of years even before him——</p>

<p>They are a pack of liars, I believe, cried
<i>Trim</i>——</p>

<p>——They are somehow or other deceived, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, in this matter, as is plain to me from the present
miserable state of military architecture amongst them; which
consists of nothing more than a fossé with a brick wall without
flanks—and for what they gave us as a bastion at each angle
of it, ’tis so barbarously constructed, that it looks for all
the world—————Like one of my seven
castles, an’ please your honour, quoth <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, tho’ in the utmost distress for a
comparison, most courteously refused <i>Trim</i>’s
offer—till <i>Trim</i> telling him, he had half a dozen more
in <i>Bohemia</i>, which he knew not how to get off his
hands——my uncle <i>Toby</i> was so touch’d with
the pleasantry of heart of the corporal——that he
discontinued his dissertation upon gun-powder——and
begged the corporal forthwith to go on with his story of the King
of <i>Bohemia</i> and his seven castles.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>THE STORY OF THE<br>
KING OF BOHEMIA AND<br>
HIS SEVEN CASTLES,<br>
CONTINUED</small>
</p>

<p>T<small>HIS</small> unfortunate King of
<i>Bohemia</i>, said <i>Trim</i>,——Was he unfortunate,
then? cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for he had been so wrapt up in
his dissertation upon gun-powder, and other military affairs, that
tho’ he had desired the corporal to go on, yet the many
interruptions he had given, dwelt not so strong upon his fancy as
to account for the epithet——Was he <i>unfortunate</i>,
then, <i>Trim?</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
pathetically——The corporal, wishing first the word and
all its synonimas at the devil, forthwith began to run back in his
mind, the principal events in the King of <i>Bohemia</i>’s
story; from every one of which, it appearing that he was the most
fortunate man that ever existed in the world——it put
the corporal to a stand: for not caring to retract his
epithet——and less to explain it——and least
of all, to twist his tale (like men of lore) to serve a
system——he looked up in my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
face for assistance——but seeing it was the very thing
my uncle <i>Toby</i> sat in expectation of
himself——after a hum and a haw, he went
on——</p>

<p>The King of <i>Bohemia</i>, an’ please your honour,
replied the corporal, was <i>unfortunate</i>, as
thus——That taking great pleasure and delight in
navigation and all sort of sea affairs——and there
<i>happening</i> throughout the whole kingdom of <i>Bohemia</i>, to
be no sea-port town whatever——</p>

<p>How the duce should there—<i>Trim?</i> cried my
uncle <i>Toby;</i> for <i>Bohemia</i> being totally inland, it
could have happen’d no otherwise——It might, said
<i>Trim</i>, if it had pleased God——</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> never spoke of the being and natural
attributes of God, but with diffidence and
hesitation——</p>

<p>——I believe not, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, after
some pause—for being inland, as I said, and having
<i>Silesia</i> and <i>Moravia</i> to the east; <i>Lusatia</i> and
<i>Upper Saxony</i> to the north; <i>Franconia</i> to the
west; and <i>Bavaria</i> to the south; <i>Bohemia</i> could not
have been propell’d to the sea without ceasing to be
<i>Bohemia</i>——nor could the sea, on the other hand,
have come up to <i>Bohemia</i>, without overflowing a great part of
<i>Germany</i>, and destroying millions of unfortunate inhabitants
who could make no defence against it——Scandalous! cried
<i>Trim</i>—Which would bespeak, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
mildly, such a want of compassion in him who is the father of
it——that, I think, <i>Trim</i>——the thing
could have happen’d no way.</p>

<p>The corporal made the bow of unfeign’d conviction; and
went on.</p>

<p>Now the King of <i>Bohemia</i> with his queen and courtiers
<i>happening</i> one fine summer’s evening to walk
out——Aye! there the word <i>happening</i> is right,
<i>Trim</i>, cried my uncle <i>Toby;</i> for the King of
<i>Bohemia</i> and his queen might have walk’d out or let it
alone:——’twas a matter of contingency, which
might happen, or not, just as chance ordered it.</p>

<p>King <i>William</i> was of an opinion, an’ please your
honour, quoth <i>Trim</i>, that every thing was predestined for us
in this world; insomuch, that he would often say to his soldiers,
that “every ball had its billet.” He was a great man,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——And I believe, continued
<i>Trim</i>, to this day, that the shot which disabled me at the
battle of <i>Landen</i>, was pointed at my knee for no other
purpose, but to take me out of his service, and place me in your
honour’s, where I should be taken so much better care of in
my old age——It shall never, <i>Trim</i>, be construed
otherwise, said my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>The heart, both of the master and the man, were alike subject to
sudden over-flowings;——a short silence ensued.</p>

<p>Besides, said the corporal, resuming the discourse—but in
a gayer accent——if it had not been for that single
shot, I had never, ’an please your honour, been in
love——</p>

<p>So, thou wast once in love, <i>Trim!</i> said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, smiling——</p>

<p>Souse! replied the corporal—over head and ears! an’
please your honour. Prithee when? where?—and how came it to
pass?—I never heard one word of it before; quoth my uncle
<i>Toby:</i>——I dare say, answered <i>Trim</i>, that
every drummer and serjeant’s son in the regiment knew of
it——It’s high time I should——said my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>Your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total
rout and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of
<i>Landen;</i> every one was left to shift for himself; and if it
had not been for the regiments of <i>Wyndham, Lumley</i>, and
<i>Galway</i>, which covered the retreat over the bridge
<i>Neerspeeken</i>, the king himself could scarce have gained
it——he was press’d hard, as your honour knows, on
every side of him——</p>

<p>Gallant mortal! cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, caught up with
enthusiasm—this moment, now that all is lost, I see him
galloping across me, corporal, to the left, to bring up the remains
of the <i>English</i> horse along with him to support the right,
and tear the laurel from <i>Luxembourg</i>’s
brows, if yet ’tis possible——I see him with the
knot of his scarfe just shot off, infusing fresh spirits into poor
<i>Galway</i>’s regiment—riding along the
line—then wheeling about, and charging <i>Conti</i> at the
head of it——Brave, brave, by heaven! cried my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—he deserves a crown——As richly, as a
thief a halter; shouted <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> knew the corporal’s
loyalty;—otherwise the comparison was not at all to his
mind——it did not altogether strike the corporal’s
fancy when he had made it——but it could not be
recall’d——so he had nothing to do, but
proceed.</p>

<p>As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to
think of any thing but his own safety—Though <i>Talmash</i>,
said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, brought off the foot with great
prudence——But I was left upon the field, said the
corporal. Thou wast so; poor fellow! replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—So that it was noon the next day, continued the
corporal, before I was exchanged, and put into a cart
with thirteen or fourteen more, in order to be convey’d to
our hospital.</p>

<p>There is no part of the body, an’ please your honour,
where a wound occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the
knee——</p>

<p>Except the groin; said my uncle <i>Toby.</i> An’ please
your honour, replied the corporal, the knee, in my opinion, must
certainly be the most acute, there being so many tendons and
what-d’ye-call-’ems all about it.</p>

<p>It is for that reason, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, that the
groin is infinitely more sensible——there being not only
as many tendons and what-d’ye-call-’ems (for I know
their names as little as thou dost)——about
it——but moreover * * *——</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, who had been all the time in her
arbour—instantly stopp’d her
breath—unpinn’d her mob at the chin, and stood upon one
leg——</p>

<p>The dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt
my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> for some time; till
<i>Trim</i> at length recollecting that he had often cried at his
master’s sufferings, but never shed a tear at his
own—was for giving up the point, which my uncle <i>Toby</i>
would not allow——’Tis a proof of nothing,
<i>Trim</i>, said he, but the generosity of thy
temper——</p>

<p>So that whether the pain of a wound in the groin (cæteris
paribus) is greater than the pain of a wound in the
knee——or</p>

<p>Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the
pain of a wound in the groin——are points which to this
day remain unsettled.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIV</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> anguish of my knee, continued the
corporal, was excessive in itself; and the uneasiness of the cart,
with the roughness of the roads, which were terribly cut
up—making bad still worse—every step was death to me: so that with
the loss of blood, and the want of care-taking of me, and a fever I
felt coming on besides——(Poor soul! said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>)——all together, an’ please your
honour, was more than I could sustain.</p>

<p>I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a
peasant’s house, where our cart, which was the last of the
line, had halted; they had help’d me in, and the young woman
had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp’d it upon
some sugar, and seeing it had cheer’d me, she had given it me
a second and a third time——So I was telling her,
an’ please your honour, the anguish I was in, and was saying
it was so intolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down upon
the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the
room—and die, than go on——when, upon her
attempting to lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was a
good soul! as your honour, said the corporal, wiping his eyes, will
hear.</p>

<p>I thought <i>love</i> had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>’Tis the most serious thing, an’ please your honour
(sometimes), that is in the world.</p>

<p>By the persuasion of the young woman, continued the corporal,
the cart with the wounded men set off without me: she had assured
them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart. So
when I came to myself——I found myself in a still quiet
cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the peasant and his
wife. I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room, with my
wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman beside me, holding
the corner of her handkerchief dipp’d in vinegar to my nose
with one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other.</p>

<p>I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant (for it was
no inn)—so had offer’d her a little purse with eighteen
florins, which my poor brother <i>Tom</i> (here <i>Trim</i>
wip’d his eyes) had sent me as a token, by a recruit, just before he set out for
<i>Lisbon</i>——</p>

<p>——I never told your honour that piteous story
yet——here <i>Trim</i> wiped his eyes a third time.</p>

<p>The young woman call’d the old man and his wife into the
room, to shew them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed
and what little necessaries I should want, till I should be in a
condition to be got to the hospital——Come then! said
she, tying up the little purse—I’ll be your
banker—but as that office alone will not keep me
employ’d, I’ll be your nurse too.</p>

<p>I thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her
dress, which I then began to consider more
attentively——that the young woman could not be the
daughter of the peasant.</p>

<p>She was in black down to her toes, with her hair conceal’d
under a cambric border, laid close to her forehead: she was one of
those kind of nuns, an’ please your honour, of which, your
honour knows, there are a good many in <i>Flanders</i>,
which they let go loose——By thy description,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I dare say she was a young
<i>Beguine</i>, of which there are none to be found any where but
in the <i>Spanish Netherlands</i>—except at
<i>Amsterdam</i>——they differ from nuns in this, that
they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry; they visit
and take care of the sick by profession——I had rather,
for my own part, they did it out of good-nature.</p>

<p>——She often told me, quoth <i>Trim</i>, she did it
for the love of Christ—I did not like it.——I
believe, <i>Trim</i>, we are both wrong, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—we’ll ask Mr. <i>Yorick</i> about it
to-night at my brother <i>Shandy</i>’s——so put me
in mind; added my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>The young <i>Beguine</i>, continued the corporal, had scarce
given herself time to tell me “she would be my nurse,”
when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one, and
prepare something for me——and in a short
time—though I thought it a long one—she came back with
flannels, &amp;c. &amp;c. and having fomented my knee soundly for a
couple of hours, &amp;c. and made me a thin bason of gruel for my
supper—she wish’d me rest, and promised to be with me
early in the morning.——She wish’d me, an’
please your honour, what was not to be had. My fever ran very high
that night—her figure made sad disturbance within me—I
was every moment cutting the world in two—to give her half of
it—and every moment was I crying, That I had nothing but a
knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her——The
whole night long was the fair <i>Beguine</i>, like an angel, close
by my bed-side, holding back my curtain and offering me
cordials—and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming
there at the hour promised, and giving them in reality. In truth,
she was scarce ever from me; and so accustomed was I to receive
life from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost colour when
she left the room: and yet, continued the corporal (making one of the strangest reflections upon it in
the world)——</p>

<p>
——“<i>It was not love</i>”——for during the
three weeks she was almost constantly with me, fomenting my knee with her hand,
night and day—I can honestly say, an’ please your honour—that
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * once.
</p>

<p>That was very odd, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>I think so too—said Mrs. <i>Wadman.</i></p>

<p>It never did, said the corporal.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLV</small>
</h3>

<p>——But ’tis no marvel, continued the
corporal—seeing my uncle <i>Toby</i> musing upon it—for
Love, an’ please your honour, is exactly like war, in this;
that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks complete
o’<i>Saturday</i> night,—may nevertheless be shot
through his heart on <i>Sunday</i> morning——<i>It
happened so here</i>, an’ please your honour, with this
difference only—that it was on <i>Sunday</i> in the afternoon, when I fell in love all
at once with a sisserara——It burst upon me, an’
please your honour, like a bomb——scarce giving me time
to say, “God bless me.”</p>

<p>I thought, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, a man never
fell in love so very suddenly.</p>

<p>Yes, an’ please your honour, if he is in the way of
it——replied <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>I prithee, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, inform me how this matter
happened.</p>

<p>——With all pleasure, said the corporal, making a
bow.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVI</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>HAD</small> escaped, continued the
corporal, all that time from falling in love, and had gone on to
the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined
otherwise——there is no resisting our fate.</p>

<p>It was on a <i>Sunday</i>, in the afternoon, as I told your
honour.</p>

<p>The old man and his wife had walked
out——</p>

<p>Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the
house——</p>

<p>There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the
yard——</p>

<p>——When the fair <i>Beguine</i> came in to see
me.</p>

<p>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well——the
inflammation had been gone off for some time, but it was succeeded
with an itching both above and below my knee, so insufferable, that
I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it.</p>

<p>Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel
to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below
it——it only wants rubbing a little, said the
<i>Beguine;</i> so covering it with the bed-clothes, she began with
the fore-finger of her right hand to rub under my knee, guiding her
fore-finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which
kept on the dressing.</p>

<p>In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of
her second finger—and presently it was laid flat with the
other, and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a
good while; it then came into my head, that I should fall in
love—I blush’d when I saw how white a hand she
had—I shall never, an’ please your honour, behold
another hand so white whilst I live——</p>

<p>——Not in that place, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——</p>

<p>Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the
corporal—he could not forbear smiling.</p>

<p>The young <i>Beguine</i>, continued the corporal, perceiving it
was of great service to me—from rubbing for some time, with
two fingers—proceeded to rub at length, with three—till
by little and little she brought down the fourth, and then
rubb’d with her whole hand: I will never say another word,
an’ please your honour, upon hands again—but it was
softer than sattin——</p>

<p>——Prithee, <i>Trim</i>, commend it as much as thou
wilt, said my uncle <i>Toby;</i> I shall hear thy story with the
more delight——The corporal thank’d his master
most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the
<i>Beguine</i>’s hand but the same over again——he
proceeded to the effects of it.</p>

<p>
The fair <i>Beguine</i>, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole
hand under my knee—till I fear’d her zeal would weary
her——“I would do a thousand times more,” said she,
“for the love of Christ”——In saying which, she
pass’d her hand across the flannel, to the part above my knee, which I
had equally complain’d of, and rubb’d it also.
</p>

<p>I perceiv’d, then, I was beginning to be in
love——</p>

<p>As she continued rub-rub-rubbing—I felt it spread from
under her hand, an’ please your honour, to every part of my
frame——</p>

<p>The more she rubb’d, and the longer strokes she
took——the more the fire kindled in my veins——till at length, by
two or three strokes longer than the rest——my passion
rose to the highest pitch——I seiz’d her
hand——</p>

<p>——And then thou clapped’st it to thy lips,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——and madest a
speech.</p>

<p>Whether the corporal’s amour terminated precisely in the
way my uncle <i>Toby</i> described it, is not material; it is
enough that it contained in it the essence of all the love romances
which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> soon as the corporal had finished
the story of his amour—or rather my uncle <i>Toby</i> for
him—Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> silently sallied forth from her
arbour, replaced the pin in her mob, pass’d the wicker gate,
and advanced slowly towards my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
sentry-box: the disposition which <i>Trim</i> had made in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let
slipp’d——</p>

<p>——The attack was determin’d upon: it was
facilitated still more by my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s having
ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer’s shovel, the
spade, the pick-axe, the picquets, and other military stores which
lay scatter’d upon the ground where <i>Dunkirk</i>
stood—The corporal had march’d—the field was
clear.</p>

<p>Now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or
writing, or any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a
man has occasion to do—to act by plan: for if ever Plan,
independent of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters
of gold (I mean in the archives of <i>Gotham</i>)—it was
certainly the P<small>LAN</small> of Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s
attack of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his sentry-box, <small>BY</small>
P<small>LAN</small>——Now the plan hanging up in it at
this juncture, being the Plan of <i>Dunkirk</i>—and the tale
of <i>Dunkirk</i> a tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression
she could make: and besides, could she have gone upon it—the
manœuvre of fingers and hands in the attack of the
sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the fair <i>Beguine</i>’s, in <i>Trim</i>’s
story—that just then, that particular attack, however
successful before—became the most heartless attack that could
be made——</p>

<p>O! let woman alone for this. Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had scarce
open’d the wicker-gate, when her genius sported with the
change of circumstances.</p>

<p>——She formed a new attack in a moment.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——I am half distracted, captain <i>Shandy</i>, said
Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, holding up her cambrick handkerchief to her
left eye, as she approach’d the door of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s sentry-box——a mote——or
sand——or something——I know not what, has
got into this eye of mine——do look into it—it is
not in the white—</p>

<p>In saying which, Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> edged herself close in
beside my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and squeezing herself down upon the
corner of his bench, she gave him an opportunity of doing it without rising up—Do
look into it—said she.</p>

<p>Honest soul! thou didst look into it with as much innocency of
heart, as ever child look’d into a raree-shew-box; and
’twere as much a sin to have hurt thee.</p>

<p>——If a man will be peeping of his own accord into
things of that nature——I’ve nothing to say to
it——</p>

<p>
My uncle <i>Toby</i> never did: and I will answer for him, that he would have
sat quietly upon a sofa from <i>June</i> to <i>January</i> (which, you know,
takes in both the hot and cold months), with an eye as fine as the
<i>Thracian</i><a href="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> <i>Rodope</i>’s besides him,
without being able to tell, whether it was a black or blue one.
</p>

<p>The difficulty was to get my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to look at one
at all.</p>

<p>’Tis surmounted.&nbsp;&nbsp; And</p>

<p>I see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the
ashes falling out of it—looking—and looking—then
rubbing his eyes—and looking again, with twice the
good-nature that ever <i>Galileo</i> look’d for a spot in the
sun.</p>

<p>——In vain! for by all the powers which animate the
organ——Widow <i>Wadman</i>’s left eye shines this
moment as lucid as her right——there is neither mote, or
sand, or dust, or chaff, or speck, or particle of opake matter
floating in it—There is nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but
one lambent delicious fire, furtively shooting out from every part
of it, in all directions, into thine——</p>

<p>——If thou lookest, uncle <i>Toby</i>, in search of
this mote one moment longer,——thou art undone.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XLIX</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>N</small> eye is for all the world exactly
like a cannon, in this respect; That it is not so much the eye or
the cannon, in themselves, as it is the carriage of the
eye——and the carriage of the cannon, by which both the
one and the other are enabled to do so much execution. I don’t
think the comparison a bad one: However, as ’tis made and
placed at the head of the chapter, as much for use as ornament, all
I desire in return, is, that whenever I speak of Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s eyes (except once in the next period), that
you keep it in your fancy.</p>

<p>I protest, Madam, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I can see nothing
whatever in your eye.</p>

<p>It is not in the white; said Mrs <i>Wadman:</i> my uncle
<i>Toby</i> look’d with might and main into the
pupil——</p>

<p>Now of all the eyes which ever were created——from
your own, Madam, up to those of <i>Venus</i> herself, which
certainly were as venereal a pair of eyes as ever stood in a
head——there never was an eye of them all, so fitted to
rob my uncle <i>Toby</i> of his repose, as the very eye, at which
he was looking——it was not, Madam a rolling
eye——a romping or a wanton one—nor was it an eye
sparkling—petulant or imperious—of high claims and
terrifying exactions, which would have curdled at once that milk of human
nature, of which my uncle <i>Toby</i> was made up——but
’twas an eye full of gentle salutations——and soft
responses——speaking——not like the trumpet
stop of some ill-made organ, in which many an eye I talk to, holds
coarse converse——but whispering soft——like
the last low accent of an expiring
saint——“How can you live comfortless,
captain <i>Shandy</i>, and alone, without a bosom to lean your head
on——or trust your cares to?”</p>

<p>It was an eye——</p>

<p>But I shall be in love with it myself, if I say another word
about it.</p>

<p>——It did my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s business.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;L</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> is nothing shews the character
of my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in a more entertaining
light, than their different manner of deportment, under the same
accident——for I call not love a misfortune, from a
persuasion, that a man’s heart is ever the better for
it——Great God! what must my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
have been, when ’twas all benignity without it.</p>

<p>My father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject
to this passion, before he married——but from a little
subacid kind of drollish impatience in his nature, whenever it
befell him, he would never submit to it like a christian; but would
pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick, and play the Devil, and write
the bitterest Philippicks against the eye that ever man
wrote——there is one in verse upon somebody’s eye
or other, that for two or three nights together, had put him by his
rest; which in his first transport of resentment against it, he
begins thus:</p>

<p class="poem">
“A Devil ’tis——and mischief such doth work<br>
As never yet did <i>Pagan, Jew</i>, or <i>Turk.</i>”<a href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In short, during the whole paroxism, my father was all abuse and
foul language, approaching rather towards
malediction——only he did not do it with as much method
as <i>Ernulphus</i>——he was too impetuous; nor with
<i>Ernulphus</i>’s policy——for tho’ my
father, with the most intolerant spirit, would curse both this and
that, and every thing under heaven, which was either aiding or
abetting to his love——yet never concluded his chapter
of curses upon it, without cursing himself in at the bargain, as
one of the most egregious fools and cox-combs, he would say, that
ever was let loose in the world.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, on the contrary, took it like a
lamb——sat still and let the poison work in his veins
without resistance——in the sharpest exacerbations of
his wound (like that on his groin) he never dropt one fretful or
discontented word——he blamed neither heaven nor
earth——or thought or spoke an injurious thing of any
body, or any part of it; he sat solitary and pensive with his
pipe——looking at his lame leg——then
whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho! which mixing with the smoke, incommoded no one
mortal.</p>

<p>He took it like a lamb——I say.</p>

<p>
In truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my father,
that very morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood, which the dean and
chapter were hewing down to give to the poor;<a href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> which said wood
being in full view of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s house, and of singular
service to him in his description of the battle of <i>Wynnendale</i>—by
trotting on too hastily to save it——upon an uneasy
saddle——worse horse, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it had so
happened, that the serous part of the blood had got betwixt the two skins, in
the nethermost part of my uncle <i>Toby</i>——the first shootings of
which (as my uncle <i>Toby</i> had no experience of love) he had taken for a
part of the passion—till the blister breaking in the one case—and
the other remaining—my uncle <i>Toby</i> was presently convinced, that
his wound was not a skin-deep wound——but that it had gone to his
heart.

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> world is ashamed of being
virtuous——my uncle <i>Toby</i> knew little of the
world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow
<i>Wadman</i>, he had no conception that the thing was any more to
be made a mystery of, than if Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had given him a
cut with a gap’d knife across his finger: Had it been
otherwise——yet as he ever look’d upon <i>Trim</i>
as a humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to
treat him as such——it would have made no variation in
the manner in which he informed him of the affair.</p>

<p>“I am in love, corporal!” quoth my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>N</small> love!——said the
corporal—your honour was very well the day before yesterday,
when I was telling your honour of the story of the King of
<i>Bohemia—Bohemia!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i> - - - -
musing a long time - - - What became of that story,
<i>Trim?</i></p>

<p>—We lost it, an’ please your honour, somehow betwixt
us—but your honour was as free from love then, as I
am——’twas just whilst thou went’st off with
the wheel-barrow——with Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>——She has left a ball here—added
my uncle <i>Toby</i>—pointing to his breast——</p>

<p>——She can no more, an’ please your honour,
stand a siege, than she can fly—cried the
corporal——</p>

<p>——But as we are neighbours, <i>Trim</i>,—the
best way I think is to let her know it civilly first—quoth my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>Now if I might presume, said the corporal, to differ from your
honour——</p>

<p>—Why else do I talk to thee, <i>Trim?</i> said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, mildly——</p>

<p>—Then I would begin, an’ please your honour, with
making a good thundering attack upon her, in return—and
telling her civilly afterwards—for if she knows any thing of
your honour’s being in love, before
hand——L—d help her!—she knows no more at
present of it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>—than
the child unborn——</p>

<p>Precious souls!——</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had told it, with all its circumstances, to
Mrs. <i>Bridget</i> twenty-four hours before; and was at that very
moment sitting in council with her, touching some slight misgivings
with regard to the issue of the affairs, which the Devil, who never
lies dead in a ditch, had put into her head—before he would
allow half time, to get quietly through her <i>Te Deum.</i></p>

<p>I am terribly afraid, said widow <i>Wadman</i>, in case I should
marry him, <i>Bridget</i>—that the poor captain will not enjoy his
health, with the monstrous wound upon his groin——</p>

<p>It may not, Madam, be so very large, replied <i>Bridget</i>, as
you think——and I believe, besides, added she—that
’tis dried up——</p>

<p>——I could like to know—merely for his sake,
said Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>——</p>

<p>—We’ll know and long and the broad of it, in ten
days—answered Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, for whilst the captain is
paying his addresses to you—I’m confident Mr.
<i>Trim</i> will be for making love to me—and I’ll let
him as much as he will—added <i>Bridget</i>—to get it
all out of him——</p>

<p>The measures were taken at once——and my uncle
<i>Toby</i> and the corporal went on with theirs.</p>

<p>Now, quoth the corporal, setting his left hand a-kimbo, and
giving such a flourish with his right, as just promised
success—and no more——if your honour will give me
leave to lay down the plan of this attack——</p>

<p>——Thou wilt please me by it, <i>Trim</i>, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, exceedingly—and as I foresee thou must act
in it as my <i>aid de camp</i>, here’s a crown, corporal, to
begin with, to steep thy commission.</p>

<p>Then, an’ please your honour, said the corporal (making a
bow first for his commission)—we will begin with getting your
honour’s laced clothes out of the great campaign-trunk, to be
well air’d, and have the blue and gold taken up at the
sleeves—and I’ll put your white ramallie-wig fresh into
pipes—and send for a taylor, to have your honour’s thin
scarlet breeches turn’d——</p>

<p>—I had better take the red plush ones, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—They will be too clumsy—said the
corporal.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIII</small>
</h3>

<p>——Thou wilt get a brush and a little chalk to my
sword——’Twill be only in your honour’s way,
replied <i>Trim.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIV</small>
</h3>

<p>—But your honour’s two razors shall be new
set—and I will get my <i>Montero</i> cap furbish’d up,
and put on poor lieutenant <i>Le Fever</i>’s regimental coat,
which your honour gave me to wear for his sake—and as soon as
your honour is clean shaved—and has got your clean shirt on,
with your blue and gold, or your fine
scarlet——sometimes one and sometimes
t’other—and every thing is ready for the
attack—we’ll march up boldly, as if ’twas to the
face of a bastion; and whilst your honour engages Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> in the parlour, to the right——I’ll
attack Mrs. <i>Bridget</i> in the kitchen, to the left; and having
seiz’d the pass, I’ll answer for it, said the corporal,
snapping his fingers over his head—that the day is our
own.</p>

<p>I wish I may but manage it right; said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—but I declare, corporal, I had rather march up to
the very edge of a trench——</p>

<p>—A woman is quite a different thing—said the
corporal.</p>

<p>—I suppose so, quoth my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LV</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>F</small> any thing in this world, which my
father said, could have provoked my uncle <i>Toby</i>, during the
time he was in love, it was the perverse use my father was always
making of an expression of <i>Hilarion</i> the hermit; who, in
speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and other
instrumental parts of his religion—would say—tho’
with more facetiousness than became an
hermit—“That they were the means he used, to make
his <i>ass</i> (meaning his body) leave off kicking.”</p>

<p>It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of
expressing——but of libelling, at the same time, the
desires and appetites of the lower part of us; so that for many
years of my father’s life, ’twas his constant mode of
expression—he never used the word <i>passions</i> once—but <i>ass</i> always
instead of them——So that he might be said truly, to
have been upon the bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of
some other man’s, during all that time.</p>

<p>I must here observe to you the difference betwixt</p>

<p>My father’s ass</p>

<p>and my hobby-horse—in order to keep
characters as separate as may be, in our fancies as we go
along.</p>

<p>For my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a
vicious beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about
him——’Tis the sporting little filly-folly which
carries you out for the present hour—a maggot, a butterfly, a
picture, a fiddlestick—an uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
siege—or an <i>any thing</i>, which a man makes a shift to
get a-stride on, to canter it away from the cares and solicitudes
of life—’Tis as useful a beast as is in the whole
creation—nor do I really see how the world could do without
it——</p>

<p>——But for my father’s ass——oh!
mount him—mount him—mount him—(that’s three
times, is it not?)—mount him not:—’tis a beast
concupiscent—and foul befal the man, who does not hinder him
from kicking.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LVI</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>ELL</small>! dear brother <i>Toby</i>, said
my father, upon his first seeing him after he fell in
love—and how goes it with your A<small>SSE</small>?</p>

<p>Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> thinking more of the part where he had
had the blister, than of <i>Hilarion</i>’s metaphor—and
our preconceptions having (you know) as great a power over the
sounds of words as the shapes of things, he had imagined, that my
father, who was not very ceremonious in his choice of words, had
enquired after the part by its proper name: so notwithstanding my
mother, doctor <i>Slop</i>, and Mr. <i>Yorick</i>, were sitting in
the parlour, he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father had made use of than
not. When a man is hemm’d in by two indecorums, and must
commit one of ’em—I always observe—let him chuse
which he will, the world will blame him—so I should not be
astonished if it blames my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>My A—e, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, is much
better—brother <i>Shandy</i>—My father had formed great
expectations from his Asse in this onset; and would have brought
him on again; but doctor <i>Slop</i> setting up an intemperate
laugh—and my mother crying out L— bless us!—it
drove my father’s Asse off the field—and the laugh then
becoming general—there was no bringing him back to the
charge, for some time——</p>

<p>And so the discourse went on without him.</p>

<p>Every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother
<i>Toby</i>,—and we hope it is true.</p>

<p>I am as much in love, sister, I believe, replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, as any man usually is——Humph! said my
father——and when did you know it? quoth my
mother——</p>

<p>——When the blister broke; replied my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>’s reply put my father into good
temper—so he charg’d o’ foot.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LVII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> the ancients agree, brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father, that there are two different and
distinct kinds of love, according to the different parts which are
affected by it—the Brain or Liver——I think when a
man is in love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the
two he is fallen into.</p>

<p>What signifies it, brother <i>Shandy</i>, replied my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, which of the two it is, provided it will but make a
man marry, and love his wife, and get a few children?</p>

<p>——A few children! cried my father, rising out of his
chair, and looking full in my mother’s face, as he forced his
way betwixt her’s and doctor <i>Slop</i>’s—a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s words as he walk’d to and
fro——</p>

<p>——Not, my dear brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father,
recovering himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s chair—not that I should be sorry
hadst thou a score—on the contrary, I should
rejoice—and be as kind, <i>Toby</i>, to every one of them as
a father—</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> stole his hand unperceived behind his
chair, to give my father’s a squeeze——</p>

<p>——Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my
uncle <i>Toby</i>’s hand—so much dost thou possess, my
dear <i>Toby</i>, of the milk of human nature, and so little of its
asperities—’tis piteous the world is not peopled by
creatures which resemble thee; and was I an <i>Asiatic</i> monarch,
added my father, heating himself with his new project—I would
oblige thee, provided it would not impair thy strength—or dry
up thy radical moisture too fast—or weaken thy memory or
fancy, brother <i>Toby</i>, which these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do—else, dear
<i>Toby</i>, I would procure thee the most beautiful woman in my
empire, and I would oblige thee, <i>nolens, volens</i>, to beget
for me one subject every <i>month</i>——</p>

<p>As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence—my
mother took a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>Now I would not, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, get a child,
<i>nolens, volens</i>, that is, whether I would or no, to please
the greatest prince upon earth——</p>

<p>——And ’twould be cruel in me, brother
<i>Toby</i>, to compel thee; said my father—but ’tis a
case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting a
child—in case thou should’st be able—but the
system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon, which I would set thee
right in——</p>

<p>There is at least, said <i>Yorick</i>, a great deal of reason
and plain sense in captain <i>Shandy</i>’s opinion of love;
and ’tis amongst the ill-spent hours of my life, which I have
to answer for, that I have read so many flourishing poets and
rhetoricians in my time, from whom I never could
extract so much——</p>

<p>I wish, <i>Yorick</i>, said my father, you had read
<i>Plato;</i> for there you would have learnt that there are two
L<small>OVES</small>—I know there were two
R<small>ELIGIONS</small>, replied <i>Yorick</i>, amongst the
ancients——one—for the vulgar, and another for the
learned;—but I think <small>ONE</small> L<small>OVE</small>
might have served both of them very well—</p>

<p>I could not; replied my father—and for the same reasons:
for of these Loves, according to <i>Ficinus</i>’s comment
upon <i>Velasius</i>, the one is rational——</p>

<p>——the other is <i>natural</i>——<br>
the first ancient——without mother——where
<i>Venus</i> had nothing to do: the second, begotten of
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Dione</i>—</p>

<p>——Pray, brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, what
has a man who believes in God to do with this? My father could not
stop to answer, for fear of breaking the thread of his
discourse——</p>

<p>This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of
<i>Venus.</i></p>

<p>The first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven,
excites to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the
desire of philosophy and truth——the second, excites to
<i>desire</i>, simply——</p>

<p>——I think the procreation of children as beneficial
to the world, said <i>Yorick</i>, as the finding out the
longitude——</p>

<p>——To be sure, said my mother, <i>love</i> keeps
peace in the world——</p>

<p>——In the <i>house</i>—my dear, I
own—</p>

<p>——It replenishes the earth; said my
mother——</p>

<p>But it keeps heaven empty—my dear; replied my father.</p>

<p>——’Tis Virginity, cried <i>Slop</i>,
triumphantly, which fills paradise.</p>

<p>Well push’d nun! quoth my father.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> father had such a skirmishing,
cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations,
thrusting and ripping, and giving every one a re were twenty people in company—in less than half an hour
he was sure to have every one of ’em against him.</p>

<p>What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an
ally, was, that if there was any one post more untenable than the
rest, he would be sure to throw himself into it; and to do him
justice, when he was once there, he would defend it so gallantly,
that ’twould have been a concern, either to a brave man or a
good-natured one, to have seen him driven out.</p>

<p><i>Yorick</i>, for this reason, though he would often attack
him—yet could never bear to do it with all his force.</p>

<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i>’s V<small>IRGINITY</small>, in the
close of the last chapter, had got him for once on the right side
of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow up all the convents in
<i>Christendom</i> about <i>Slop</i>’s ears, when corporal
<i>Trim</i> came into the parlour to inform my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
that his thin scarlet breeches, in which the attack was to be made
upon Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, would not do; for that the taylor, in
ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had been
turn’d before——Then turn them again, brother,
said my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of
’em yet before all’s done in the
affair——They are as rotten as dirt, said the
corporal——Then by all means, said my father, bespeak a
new pair, brother——for though I know, continued my
father, turning himself to the company, that widow <i>Wadman</i>
has been deeply in love with my brother <i>Toby</i> for many years,
and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him
into the same passion, yet now that she has caught
him——her fever will be pass’d its
height——</p>

<p>——She has gained her point.</p>

<p>In this case, continued my father, which <i>Plato</i>, I am
persuaded, never thought of——Love, you see, is not so
much a S<small>ENTIMENT</small> as a S<small>ITUATION</small>, into
which a man enters, as my brother <i>Toby</i> would do, into a
<i>corps</i>——no matter whether he loves the service or
no——being once in it—he acts as if he did; and
takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.</p>

<p>The hypothesis, like the rest of my father’s, was
plausible enough, and my uncle <i>Toby</i> had but a single word to
object to it—in which <i>Trim</i> stood ready to second
him——but my father had not drawn his
conclusion——</p>

<p>For this reason, continued my father (stating the case over
again)—notwithstanding all the world knows, that Mrs.
<i>Wadman affects</i> my brother <i>Toby</i>—and my brother
<i>Toby</i> contrariwise <i>affects</i> Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, and no
obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night,
yet will I answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be
play’d this twelvemonth.</p>

<p>We have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
looking up interrogatively in <i>Trim</i>’s face.</p>

<p>I would lay my <i>Montero</i>-cap, said
<i>Trim</i>——Now <i>Trim</i>’s
<i>Montero</i>-cap, as I once told you, was his constant wager; and having furbish’d it up that very night, in
order to go upon the attack—it made the odds look more
considerable——I would lay, an’ please your
honour, my <i>Montero</i>-cap to a shilling—was it proper,
continued <i>Trim</i> (making a bow), to offer a wager before your
honours——</p>

<p>——There is nothing improper in it, said my
father—’tis a mode of expression; for in saying thou
would’st lay thy <i>Montero</i>-cap to a shilling—all
thou meanest is this—that thou believest——</p>

<p>——Now, What do’st thou believe?</p>

<p>That widow <i>Wadman</i>, an’ please your worship, cannot
hold it out ten days——</p>

<p>And whence, cried <i>Slop</i>, jeeringly, hast thou all this
knowledge of woman, friend?</p>

<p>By falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said
<i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>’Twas a <i>Beguine</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i> was too much in wrath to listen to the
distinction; and my father taking that very crisis to fall in
helter-skelter upon the whole order of Nuns and <i>Beguines</i>, a
set of silly, fusty, baggages——<i>Slop</i> could not stand
it——and my uncle Toby having some measures to take
about his breeches—and <i>Yorick</i> about his fourth general
division—in order for their several attacks next
day—the company broke up: and my father being left alone, and
having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and bed-time; he
called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote my uncle <i>Toby</i> the
following letter of instructions:</p>

<p>My dear brother <i>Toby</i>,</p>

<p>W<small>HAT</small> I am going to say to thee is
upon the nature of women, and of love-making to them; and perhaps
it is as well for thee—tho’ not so well for
me—that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon
that head, and that I am able to write it to thee.</p>

<p>Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our
lots—and thou no sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well content that thou should’st have
dipp’d the pen this moment into the ink, instead of myself;
but that not being the case———Mrs <i>Shandy</i>
being now close beside me, preparing for bed——I have
thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my
mind, such hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee;
intending, in this, to give thee a token of my love; not doubting,
my dear <i>Toby</i>, of the manner in which it will be
accepted.</p>

<p>In the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion
in the affair——though I perceive from a glow in my
cheek, that I blush as I begin to speak to thee upon the subject,
as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of
its offices thou neglectest—yet I would remind thee of one
(during the continuance of thy courtship) in a particular manner,
which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go forth upon
the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,
without first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty God, that he may defend thee
from the evil one.</p>

<p>Shave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four
or five days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig
before her, thro’ absence of mind, she should be able to
discover how much has been cut away by Time——how much
by <i>Trim.</i></p>

<p>—’Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her
fancy.</p>

<p>Always carry it in thy mind, and act upon it as a sure maxim,
<i>Toby</i>——</p>

<p>
“<i>That women are timid:</i>” And ’tis well they
are——else there would be no dealing with them.
</p>

<p>Let not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy
thighs, like the trunk-hose of our ancestors.</p>

<p>——A just medium prevents all conclusions.</p>

<p>Whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to
utter it in a low soft tone of voice. Silence, and whatever
approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain:
For this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the
tongs and poker.</p>

<p>Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse
with her, and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time, to
keep her from all books and writings which tend thereto: there are
some devotional tracts, which if thou canst entice her to read
over—it will be well: but suffer her not to look into
<i>Rabelais</i>, or <i>Scarron</i>, or <i>Don
Quixote</i>——</p>

<p>——They are all books which excite laughter; and thou
knowest, dear <i>Toby</i>, that there is no passion so serious as
lust.</p>

<p>Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her
parlour.</p>

<p>And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her,
and she gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers—beware
of taking it——thou canst not lay thy hand on hers, but
she will feel the temper of thine. Leave that and as many other
things as thou canst, quite undetermined; by so doing, thou wilt
have her curiosity on thy side; and if she is not conquered by that, and thy Asse continues
still kicking, which there is great reason to
suppose——Thou must begin, with first losing a few
ounces of blood below the ears, according to the practice of the
ancient <i>Scythians</i>, who cured the most intemperate fits of
the appetite by that means.</p>

<p><i>Avicenna</i>, after this, is for having the part anointed
with the syrup of hellebore, using proper evacuations and
purges——and I believe rightly. But thou must eat little
or no goat’s flesh, nor red deer——nor even
foal’s flesh by any means; and carefully
abstain——that is, as much as thou canst, from peacocks,
cranes, coots, didappers, and water-hens——</p>

<p>As for thy drink—I need not tell thee, it must be the
infusion of V<small>ERVAIN</small> and the herb
H<small>ANEA</small>, of which <i>Ælian</i> relates such
effects—but if thy stomach palls with it—discontinue it
from time to time, taking cucumbers, melons, purslane,
water-lillies, woodbine, and lettice, in the stead of them.</p>

<p>There is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at
present——</p>

<p>——Unless the breaking out of a fresh
war——So wishing every thing, dear <i>Toby</i>, for
best,</p>

<p>I rest thy affectionate brother,</p>

<p>W<small>ALTER</small> S<small>HANDY</small>.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LIX</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HILST</small> my father was writing his
letter of instructions, my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal were
busy in preparing every thing for the attack. As the turning of the
thin scarlet breeches was laid aside (at least for the present),
there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning;
so accordingly it was resolv’d upon, for eleven
o’clock.</p>

<p>Come, my dear, said my father to my mother—’twill be
but like a brother and sister, if you and I take a walk down to my
brother <i>Toby</i>’s——to countenance him in this
attack of his.</p>

<p>
My uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal had been accoutred both some time, when
my father and mother enter’d, and the clock striking eleven, were that
moment in motion to sally forth—but the account of this is worth more
than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth<a href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> volume of such a
work as this.——My father had no time but to put the letter of
instructions into my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s coat-pocket——and
join with my mother in wishing his attack prosperous.
</p>

<p>I could like, said my mother, to look through the key-hole out
of <i>curiosity</i>——Call it by its right name, my
dear, quoth my father—</p>

<p><i>And look through the key-hole</i> as long as you will.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="linknote-43" id="linknote-43"></a> <a href="#linknoteref-43">[43]</a>
Alluding to the first edition.
</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LX</small>
</h3>

<p>I <small>CALL</small> all the powers of time and
chance, which severally check us in our careers in this world, to
bear me witness, that I could never yet get fairly to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s amours, till this very moment, that my
mother’s <i>curiosity</i>, as she stated the
affair,——or a different impulse in her, as my father
would have it——wished her to take a peep at them
through the key-hole.</p>

<p>“Call it, my dear, by its right name, quoth my
father, and look through the key-hole as long as you
will.”</p>

<p>Nothing but the fermentation of that little subacid humour,
which I have often spoken of, in my father’s habit, could
have vented such an insinuation——he was however frank
and generous in his nature, and at all times open to conviction; so
that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort,
when his conscience smote him.</p>

<p>My mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted
under his right, in such wise, that the inside of her hand rested
upon the back of his—she raised her fingers, and let them
fall—it could scarce be call’d a tap; or if it was a
tap——’twould have puzzled a casuist to say,
whether ’twas a tap of remonstrance, or a tap of confession:
my father, who was all sensibilities from head to foot,
class’d it right—Conscience redoubled her blow—he
turn’d his face suddenly the other way, and my mother
supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move
homewards, by a cross movement of her right leg, keeping her left
as its centre, brought herself so far in front, that as he turned
his head, he met her eye——Confusion again! he saw a
thousand reasons to wipe out the reproach, and as many to reproach
himself——a thin, blue, chill, pellucid chrystal with
all its humours so at rest, the least mote or speck of desire might
have been seen, at the bottom of it, had it existed——it
did not——and how I happen to be so lewd myself, particularly a
little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes——Heaven
above knows——My
mother——madam——was so at no time, either by
nature, by institution, or example.</p>

<p>A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in
all months of the year, and in all critical moments both of the day
and night alike; nor did she superinduce the least heat into her
humours from the manual effervescencies of devotional tracts, which
having little or no meaning in them, nature is oft-times obliged to
find one——And as for my father’s example!
’twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto,
that ’twas the whole business of his life, to keep all
fancies of that kind out of her head——Nature had done
her part, to have spared him this trouble; and what was not a
little inconsistent, my father knew it——And here am I
sitting, this 12th day of <i>August</i> 1766, in a purple jerkin
and yellow pair of slippers, without either wig or cap on, a
most tragicomical completion of his prediction,
“That I should neither think, nor act like any other
man’s child, upon that very account.”</p>

<p>The mistake in my father, was in attacking my mother’s
motive, instead of the act itself; for certainly key-holes were
made for other purposes; and considering the act, as an act which
interfered with a true proposition, and denied a key-hole to be
what it was——it became a violation of nature; and was
so far, you see, criminal.</p>

<p>It is for this reason, an’ please your Reverences, That
key-holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all
other holes in this world put together.</p>

<p>——which leads me to my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
amours.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HOUGH</small> the corporal had been as good
as his word in putting my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s great
ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any
great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in the
corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so easy
to be got the better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well
understood, it was not so pliable a business as one would have
wished. The corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended, had
fallen back perpendicular from it a score times, to inspire it, if
possible, with a better air——had <small>SPLEEN</small>
given a look at it, ’twould have cost her ladyship a
smile——it curl’d every where but where the
corporal would have it; and where a buckle or two, in his opinion,
would have done it honour, he could as soon have raised the
dead.</p>

<p>Such it was——or rather such would it have
seem’d upon any other brow; but the sweet look of goodness
which sat upon my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s, assimilated every
thing around it so sovereignly to itself, and Nature had moreover
wrote G<small>ENTLEMAN</small> with so fair a hand in every line of
his countenance, that even his tarnish’d gold-laced hat and
huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him; and though not worth a
button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle <i>Toby</i> put them
on, they became serious objects, and altogether seem’d to
have been picked up by the hand of Science to set him off to
advantage.</p>

<p>Nothing in this world could have co-operated more powerfully
towards this, than my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s blue and
gold——<i>had not Quantity in some measure been
necessary to Grace:</i> in a period of fifteen or sixteen years
since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s life, for he seldom went further than the
bowling-green—his blue and gold had become so miserably too
straight for him, that it was with the utmost difficulty the corporal
was able to get him into them; the taking them up at the sleeves,
was of no advantage.——They were laced however down the
back, and at the seams of the sides, &amp;c. in the mode of King
<i>William</i>’s reign; and to shorten all description, they
shone so bright against the sun that morning, and had so metallick
and doughty an air with them, that had my uncle <i>Toby</i> thought
of attacking in armour, nothing could have so well imposed upon his
imagination.</p>

<p>As for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp’d
by the taylor between the legs, and left at <i>sixes and
sevens</i>——</p>

<p>——Yes, Madam,——but let us govern our
fancies. It is enough they were held impracticable the night
before, and as there was no alternative in my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s wardrobe, he sallied forth in the red
plush.</p>

<p>The corporal had array’d himself in poor <i>Le
Fever</i>’s regimental coat; and with his hair tuck’d
up under his <i>Montero</i>-cap, which he had furbish’d
up for the occasion, march’d three paces distant
from his master: a whiff of military pride had puff’d out his
shirt at the wrist; and upon that in a black leather thong
clipp’d into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the
corporal’s stick——my uncle <i>Toby</i> carried
his cane like a pike.</p>

<p>——It looks well at least; quoth my father to
himself.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXII</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i> turn’d his
head more than once behind him, to see how he was supported by the
corporal; and the corporal as oft as he did it, gave a slight
flourish with his stick—but not vapouringly; and with the
sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honour
“never fear.”</p>

<p>Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> did fear; and grievously too; he knew
not (as my father had reproach’d him) so much as the right
end of a Woman from the wrong, and therefore was never altogether
at his ease near any one of them——unless in
sorrow or distress; then infinite was his pity; nor would the most
courteous knight of romance have gone further, at least upon one
leg, to have wiped away a tear from a woman’s eye; and yet
excepting once that he was beguiled into it by Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>,
he had never looked stedfastly into one; and would often tell my
father in the simplicity of his heart, that it was almost (if not
about) as bad as taking bawdy.——</p>

<p>——And suppose it is? my father would say.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>S<small>HE</small> cannot, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, halting, when they had march’d up to within
twenty paces of Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s door—she cannot,
corporal, take it amiss.——</p>

<p>——She will take it, an’ please your honour,
said the corporal, just as the <i>Jew</i>’s widow at
<i>Lisbon</i> took it of my brother <i>Tom.</i>——</p>

<p>——And how was that? quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
facing quite about to the corporal.</p>

<p>Your honour, replied the corporal, knows of <i>Tom</i>’s
misfortunes; but this affair has nothing to do with them any
further than this, That if <i>Tom</i> had not married the
widow——or had it pleased God after their marriage, that
they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul had
never been taken out of his warm bed, and dragg’d to the
inquisition——’Tis a cursed place—added the
corporal, shaking his head,—when once a poor creature is in,
he is in, an’ please your honour, for ever.</p>

<p>’Tis very true; said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking gravely
at Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s house, as he spoke.</p>

<p>Nothing, continued the corporal, can be so sad as confinement
for life—or so sweet, an’ please your honour, as
liberty.</p>

<p>Nothing, <i>Trim</i>——said my uncle Toby,
musing——</p>

<p>Whilst a man is free,—cried the corporal, giving a
flourish with his stick thus——</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img src="tristram_shandy_files/image10.jpg" alt="squiqqly line diagonally across the page" width="284" height="293">
</div>

<p>A thousand of my father’s most subtle
syllogisms could not have said more for celibacy.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> look’d earnestly towards his cottage
and his bowling-green.</p>

<p>The corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation
with his wand; and he had nothing to do, but to conjure him
down again with his story, and in this form of Exorcism, most
un-ecclesiastically did the corporal do it.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> <i>Tom</i>’s place,
an’ please your honour, was easy—and the weather
warm—it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself
in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a <i>Jew</i>
who kept a sausage shop in the same street, had the ill luck to die
of a strangury, and leave his widow in possession of a rousing
trade——<i>Tom</i> thought (as every body in
<i>Lisbon</i> was doing the best he could devise for himself) there
could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on: so
without any introduction to the widow, except that of buying a
pound of sausages at her shop—<i>Tom</i> set
out—counting the matter thus within himself, as he
walk’d along; that let the worst come of it that could, he should at least get
a pound of sausages for their worth—but, if things went well,
he should be set up; inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of
sausages—but a wife and—a sausage shop, an’
please your honour, into the bargain.</p>

<p>Every servant in the family, from high to low, wish’d
<i>Tom</i> success; and I can fancy, an’ please your honour,
I see him this moment with his white dimity waist-coat and
breeches, and hat a little o’ one side, passing jollily along
the street, swinging his stick, with a smile and a chearful word
for every body he met:——But alas! <i>Tom!</i>
thou smilest no more, cried the corporal, looking on one side of
him upon the ground, as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, feelingly.</p>

<p>He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an’ please your
honour, as ever blood warm’d——</p>

<p>——Then he resembled thee, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, rapidly.</p>

<p>The corporal blush’d down to his fingers ends—a tear
of sentimental bashfulness—another of gratitude to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—and a tear of sorrow for his brother’s
misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly down his cheek
together; my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s kindled as one lamp does at
another; and taking hold of the breast of <i>Trim</i>’s coat
(which had been that of <i>Le Fever</i>’s) as if to ease his
lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer feeling——he
stood silent for a minute and a half; at the end of which he took
his hand away, and the corporal making a bow, went on with his
story of his brother and the <i>Jew</i>’s widow.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> <i>Tom</i>, an’ please
your honour, got to the shop, there was nobody in it, but a poor
negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end
of a long cane, flapping away flies—not killing
them.——’Tis a pretty picture! said my uncle <i>Toby</i>—she had
suffered persecution, <i>Trim</i>, and had learnt
mercy——</p>

<p>——She was good, an’ please your honour, from
nature, as well as from hardships; and there are circumstances in
the story of that poor friendless slut, that would melt a heart of
stone, said <i>Trim;</i> and some dismal winter’s evening,
when your honour is in the humour, they shall be told you with the
rest of <i>Tom</i>’s story, for it makes a part of
it——</p>

<p>Then do not forget, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>A negro has a soul? an’ please your honour, said the
corporal (doubtingly).</p>

<p>I am not much versed, corporal, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in
things of that kind; but I suppose, God would not leave him without
one, any more than thee or me——</p>

<p>——It would be putting one sadly over the head of
another, quoth the corporal.</p>

<p>It would so; said my uncle <i>Toby.</i> Why then, an’
please your honour, is a black wench to be used worse than a white
one?</p>

<p>I can give no reason, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——</p>

<p>——Only, cried the corporal, shaking his head,
because she has no one to stand up for her——</p>

<p>——’Tis that very thing, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my
uncle <i>Toby</i>,——which recommends her to
protection——and her brethren with her; ’tis the
fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands
<i>now</i>——where it may be hereafter, heaven
knows!——but be it where it will, the brave,
<i>Trim!</i> will not use it unkindly.</p>

<p>——God forbid, said the corporal.</p>

<p>Amen, responded my uncle <i>Toby</i>, laying his hand upon his
heart.</p>

<p>The corporal returned to his story, and went on——but
with an embarrassment in doing it, which here and there a reader in
this world will not be able to comprehend; for by the many sudden transitions all along, from one kind and
cordial passion to another, in getting thus far on his way, he had
lost the sportable key of his voice, which gave sense and spirit to
his tale: he attempted twice to resume it, but could not please
himself; so giving a stout hem! to rally back the retreating
spirits, and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm a
kimbo on one side, and with his right a little extended, supporting
her on the other—the corporal got as near the note as he
could; and in that attitude, continued his story.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> <i>Tom</i>, an’ please your
honour, had no business at that time with the <i>Moorish</i> girl,
he passed on into the room beyond, to talk to the
<i>Jew</i>’s widow about love——and this pound of
sausages; and being, as I have told your honour, an open
cheary-hearted lad, with his character wrote in his looks and
carriage, he took a chair, and without much apology, but with great civility at the same
time, placed it close to her at the table, and sat down.</p>

<p>There is nothing so awkward, as courting a woman, an’
please your honour, whilst she is making sausages——So
<i>Tom</i> began a discourse upon them; first,
gravely,——“as how they were
made——with what meats, herbs, and
spices.”—Then a little gayly,—as,
“With what skins——and if they never
burst——Whether the largest were not the
best?”—and so on—taking care only as he
went along, to season what he had to say upon sausages, rather
under than over;——that he might have room to act
in——</p>

<p>It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, laying his hand upon <i>Trim</i>’s
shoulder, that Count <i>De la Motte</i> lost the battle of
<i>Wynendale:</i> he pressed too speedily into the wood; which if
he had not done, <i>Lisle</i> had not fallen into our hands, nor
<i>Ghent</i> and <i>Bruges</i>, which both followed her example; it
was so late in the year, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and so terrible a
season came on, that if things had not fallen out as they did, our
troops must have perish’d in the open
field.——</p>

<p>——Why, therefore, may not battles, an’ please
your honour, as well as marriages, be made in heaven?—my
uncle <i>Toby</i> mused——</p>

<p>Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of
military skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to
frame a reply exactly to his mind——my uncle <i>Toby</i>
said nothing at all; and the corporal finished his story.</p>

<p>As <i>Tom</i> perceived, an’ please your honour, that he
gained ground, and that all he had said upon the subject of
sausages was kindly taken, he went on to help her a little in
making them.——First, by taking hold of the ring of the
sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her
hand——then by cutting the strings into proper lengths,
and holding them in his hand, whilst she took them out one by
one——then, by putting them across her mouth, that she might
take them out as she wanted them——and so on from little
to more, till at last he adventured to tie the sausage himself,
whilst she held the snout.——</p>

<p>——Now a widow, an’ please your honour, always
chuses a second husband as unlike the first as she can: so the
affair was more than half settled in her mind before <i>Tom</i>
mentioned it.</p>

<p>She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a
sausage:——<i>Tom</i> instantly laid hold of
another——</p>

<p>But seeing <i>Tom</i>’s had more gristle in
it——</p>

<p>She signed the capitulation——and <i>Tom</i> sealed
it; and there was an end of the matter.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>LL</small> womankind, continued <i>Trim</i>,
(commenting upon his story) from the highest to the lowest,
an’ please your honour, love jokes; the difficulty is to know
how they chuse to have them cut; and there is no knowing that, but
by trying, as we do with our artillery in the field, by raising or
letting down their breeches, till we hit the
mark.——</p>

<p>——I like the comparison, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
better than the thing itself——</p>

<p>——Because your honour, quoth the corporal, loves
glory, more than pleasure.</p>

<p>I hope, <i>Trim</i>, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I love
mankind more than either; and as the knowledge of arms tends so
apparently to the good and quiet of the world——and
particularly that branch of it which we have practised together in
our bowling-green, has no object but to shorten the strides of
A<small>MBITION</small>, and intrench the lives and fortunes of the <i>few</i>,
from the plunderings of the <i>many</i>——whenever that
drum beats in our ears, I trust, corporal, we shall neither of us
want so much humanity and fellow-feeling, as to face about and
march.</p>

<p>In pronouncing this, my uncle <i>Toby</i> faced about, and
march’d firmly as at the head of his company——and
the faithful corporal, shouldering his stick, and striking his hand
upon his coat-skirt as he took his first
step——march’d close behind him down the
avenue.</p>

<p>——Now what can their two noddles be about? cried my
father to my mother——by all that’s strange, they
are besieging Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> in form, and are marching round
her house to mark out the lines of circumvallation.</p>

<p>I dare say, quoth my mother——But stop, dear
Sir——for what my mother dared to say upon the
occasion——and what my father did say upon
it——with her replies and his rejoinders, shall be read,
perused, paraphrased, commented, and descanted upon—or to
say it all in a word, shall be thumb’d over by
Posterity in a chapter apart——I say, by
Posterity—and care not, if I repeat the word again—for
what has this book done more than the Legation of <i>Moses</i>, or
the Tale of a Tub, that it may not swim down the gutter of Time
along with them?</p>

<p>I will not argue the matter: Time wastes too fast: every letter
I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen: the days
and hours of it, more precious, my dear <i>Jenny!</i> than the
rubies about thy neck, are flying over our heads like light clouds
of a windy day, never to return more——every thing
presses on——whilst thou art twisting that
lock,——see! it grows grey; and every time I kiss thy
hand to bid adieu, and every absence which follows it, are preludes
to that eternal separation which we are shortly to
make.——</p>

<p>——Heaven have mercy upon us both!</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small>, for what the world thinks of
that ejaculation——I would not give a groat.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> mother had gone with her left arm
twisted in my father’s right, till they had got to the fatal
angle of the old garden wall, where Doctor <i>Slop</i> was
overthrown by <i>Obadiah</i> on the coach-horse: as this was
directly opposite to the front of Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s house,
when my father came to it, he gave a look across; and seeing my
uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal within ten paces of the door, he
turn’d about——“Let us just stop a
moment, quoth my father, and see with what ceremonies my brother
<i>Toby</i> and his man <i>Trim</i> make their first
entry——it will not detain us, added my father, a single
minute:”——No matter, if it be ten minutes, quoth
my mother.</p>

<p>——It will not detain us half one; said my
father.</p>

<p>The corporal was just then setting in with the story of his
brother <i>Tom</i> and the <i>Jew</i>’s widow: the story went
on—and on——it had episodes in it——it
came back, and went on——and on again; there was no end
of it——the reader found it very long——</p>

<p>——G— help my father! he pish’d fifty
times at every new attitude, and gave the corporal’s stick,
with all its flourishings and danglings, to as many devils as chose
to accept of them.</p>

<p>When issues of events like these my father is waiting for, are
hanging in the scales of fate, the mind has the advantage of
changing the principle of expectation three times, without which it
would not have power to see it out.</p>

<p>Curiosity governs the <i>first moment;</i> and the second moment
is all œconomy to justify the expence of the
first——and for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth moments, and so on to the day of
judgment—’tis a point of H<small>ONOUR</small>.</p>

<p>I need not be told, that the ethic writers have assigned this
all to Patience; but that V<small>IRTUE</small>, methinks, has
extent of dominion sufficient of her own, and enough to do in it,
without invading the few dismantled castles which
H<small>ONOUR</small> has left him upon the earth.</p>

<p>My father stood it out as well as he could with these three
auxiliaries to the end of <i>Trim</i>’s story; and from
thence to the end of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s panegyrick upon
arms, in the chapter following it; when seeing, that instead of
marching up to Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s door, they both faced
about and march’d down the avenue diametrically opposite to
his expectation—he broke out at once with that little subacid
soreness of humour, which, in certain situations, distinguished his
character from that of all other men.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXX</small>
</h3>

<p>——“Now what can their two
noddles be about?” cried my father - - &amp;c. - - -
-</p>

<p>I dare say, said my mother, they are making
fortifications——</p>

<p>——Not on Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s premises! cried
my father, stepping back——</p>

<p>I suppose not: quoth my mother.</p>

<p>I wish, said my father, raising his voice, the whole science of
fortification at the devil, with all its trumpery of saps, mines,
blinds, gabions, fausse-brays and cuvetts——</p>

<p>——They are foolish things——said my
mother.</p>

<p>Now she had a way, which, by the bye, I would this moment give
away my purple jerkin, and my yellow slippers into the bargain, if
some of your reverences would imitate—and that was, never to
refuse her assent and consent to any proposition my father laid
before her, merely because she did not understand it, or had no ideas of the principal word or term of art,
upon which the tenet or proposition rolled. She contented herself
with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for
her—but no more; and so would go on using a hard word twenty
years together—and replying to it too, if it was a verb, in
all its moods and tenses, without giving herself any trouble to
enquire about it.</p>

<p>This was an eternal source of misery to my father, and broke the
neck, at the first setting out, of more good dialogues between
them, than could have done the most petulant
contradiction——the few which survived were the better
for the <i>cuvetts</i>——</p>

<p>—“They are foolish things;” said my
mother.</p>

<p>——Particularly the <i>cuvetts;</i> replied my
father.</p>

<p>’Tis enough—he tasted the sweet of triumph—and
went on.</p>

<p>—Not that they are, properly speaking, Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s premises, said my father, partly correcting himself—because she
is but tenant for life——</p>

<p>——That makes a great difference—said my
mother——</p>

<p>—In a fool’s head, replied my
father——</p>

<p>Unless she should happen to have a child—said my
mother——</p>

<p>——But she must persuade my brother <i>Toby</i> first
to get her one—</p>

<p>To be sure, Mr. <i>Shandy</i>, quoth my mother.</p>

<p>——Though if it comes to persuasion—said my
father—Lord have mercy upon them.</p>

<p>Amen: said my mother, <i>piano.</i></p>

<p>Amen: cried my father, <i>fortissimè.</i></p>

<p>Amen: said my mother again——but with such a sighing
cadence of personal pity at the end of it, as discomfited every
fibre about my father—he instantly took out his almanack; but
before he could untie it, <i>Yorick</i>’s congregation coming
out of church, became a full answer to one half of his business
with it—and my mother telling him it was a sacrament day—left
him as little in doubt, as to the other part—He put his
almanack into his pocket.</p>

<p>The first Lord of the Treasury thinking of <i>ways and
means</i>, could not have returned home with a more embarrassed
look.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXI</small>
</h3>

<p>U<small>PON</small> looking back from the end of the
last chapter, and surveying the texture of what has been wrote, it
is necessary, that upon this page and the three following, a good
quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted to keep up that just
balance betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book would not
hold together a single year: nor is it a poor creeping digression
(which but for the name of, a man might continue as well going on
in the king’s highway) which will do the
business——no; if it is to be a digression, it must be a
good frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too, where
neither the horse or his rider are to be caught, but by
rebound.</p>

<p>The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of
the service: F<small>ANCY</small> is
capricious—W<small>IT</small> must not be searched
for—and P<small>LEASANTRY</small> (good-natured slut as she
is) will not come in at a call, was an empire to be laid at her
feet.</p>

<p>——The best way for a man, is to say his
prayers——</p>

<p>Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as
well ghostly as bodily—for that purpose, he will find himself
rather worse after he has said them than before—for other
purposes, better.</p>

<p>For my own part, there is not a way either moral or mechanical
under heaven that I could think of, which I have not taken with
myself in this case: sometimes by addressing myself directly to the
soul herself, and arguing the point over and over again with her
upon the extent of her own faculties——</p>

<p>——I never could make them an inch the
wider——</p>

<p>Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it
upon the body, by temperance, soberness, and chastity: These are
good, quoth I, in themselves—they are good,
absolutely;—they are good, relatively;—they are good
for health—they are good for happiness in this
world—they are good for happiness in the
next——</p>

<p>In short, they were good for every thing but the thing wanted;
and there they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as
heaven made it: as for the theological virtues of faith and hope,
they give it courage; but then that snivelling virtue of Meekness
(as my father would always call it) takes it quite away again, so
you are exactly where you started.</p>

<p>Now in all common and ordinary cases, there is nothing which I
have found to answer so well as this——</p>

<p>——Certainly, if there is any dependence upon Logic,
and that I am not blinded by self-love, there must be something of
true genius about me, merely upon this symptom of it, that I do not
know what envy is: for never do I hit upon any invention or device
which tendeth to the furtherance of good writing, but I instantly
make it public; willing that all mankind should write as well as
myself.</p>

<p>——Which they certainly will, when they think as
little.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXII</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> in ordinary cases, that is, when
I am only stupid, and the thoughts rise heavily and pass gummous
through my pen——</p>

<p>Or that I am got, I know not how, into a cold unmetaphorical
vein of infamous writing, and cannot take a plumb-lift out of it
<i>for my soul;</i> so must be obliged to go on writing like a
<i>Dutch</i> commentator to the end of the chapter, unless
something be done—</p>

<p>——I never stand conferring with pen and ink one
moment; for if a pinch of snuff, or a stride or two across the room
will not do the business for me—I take a razor at once; and
having tried the edge of it upon the palm of my hand, without
further ceremony, except that of first lathering my beard, I shave
it off; taking care only if I do leave a hair, that it be not a
grey one: this done, I change my shirt—put on a better
coat—send for my last wig—put my topaz ring upon my
finger; and in a word, dress myself from one end to the other of
me, after my best fashion.</p>

<p>Now the devil in hell must be in it, if this does not do: for
consider, Sir, as every man chuses to be present at the shaving of
his own beard (though there is no rule without an exception), and
unavoidably sits over-against himself the whole time it is doing,
in case he has a hand in it—the Situation, like all others,
has notions of her own to put into the brain.——</p>

<p>——I maintain it, the conceits of a rough-bearded
man, are seven years more terse and juvenile for one single
operation; and if they did not run a risk of being quite shaved
away, might be carried up by continual shavings, to the highest
pitch of sublimity—How <i>Homer</i> could write with so long
a beard, I don’t know——and as it makes against my
hypothesis, I as little care——But let us return to the
Toilet.</p>

<p><i>Ludovicus Sorbonensis</i> makes this entirely an affair of
the body (εξωιεριχη
πραξις) as he calls it——but
he is deceived: the soul and body are joint-sharers in every thing
they get: A man cannot dress, but his ideas get cloth’d at
the same time; and if he dresses like a gentleman, every one of
them stands presented to his imagination, genteelized along with
him—so that he has nothing to do, but take his pen, and write
like himself.</p>

<p>For this cause, when your honours and reverences would know
whether I writ clean and fit to be read, you will be able to
judge full as well by looking into my Laundress’s bill, as my
book: there is one single month in which I can make it appear, that
I dirtied one and thirty shirts with clean writing; and after all,
was more abus’d, cursed, criticis’d, and confounded,
and had more mystic heads shaken at me, for what I had wrote in
that one month, than in all the other months of that year put
together.</p>

<p>——But their honours and reverences had not seen my
bills.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXIII</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> I never had any intention of
beginning the Digression, I am making all this preparation for,
till I come to the 74th chapter——I have this chapter to
put to whatever use I think proper——I have twenty this
moment ready for it——I could write my chapter of
Button-holes in it——</p>

<p>Or my chapter of <i>Pishes</i>, which should follow
them——</p>

<p>Or my chapter of <i>Knots</i>, in case their reverences have
done with them——they might lead me into mischief: the
safest way is to follow the track of the learned, and raise
objections against what I have been writing, tho’ I declare
before-hand, I know no more than my heels how to answer them.</p>

<p>And first, it may be said, there is a pelting kind of
<i>thersitical</i> satire, as black as the very ink ’tis
wrote with——(and by the bye, whoever says so, is
indebted to the muster-master general of the <i>Grecian</i> army,
for suffering the name of so ugly and foul-mouth’d a man as
<i>Thersites</i> to continue upon his roll——for it has
furnish’d him with an epithet)——in these
productions he will urge, all the personal washings and scrubbings
upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of good——but
just the contrary, inasmuch as the dirtier the fellow is, the
better generally he succeeds in it.</p>

<p>To this, I have no other answer——at least
ready——but that the Archbishop of <i>Benevento</i>
wrote his <i>nasty</i> Romance of the <i>Galatea</i>, as all the
world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of
breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon
the book of the <i>Revelations</i>, as severe as it was
look’d upon by one part of the world, was far from being
deem’d so, by the other, upon the single account of that
<i>Investment.</i></p>

<p>Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of
universality; forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so
much stress is laid, by an unalterable law of nature excludes one
half of the species entirely from its use: all I can say is, that
female writers, whether of <i>England</i>, or of <i>France</i>,
must e’en go without it——</p>

<p>As for the <i>Spanish</i> ladies——I am in no sort of
distress——</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXIV</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> seventy-fourth chapter is come at
last; and brings nothing with it but a sad signature of
“How our pleasures slip from under us in this
world!”</p>

<p>For in talking of my digression——I declare before
heaven I have made it! What a strange creature is mortal man! said
she.</p>

<p>’Tis very true, said I——but ’twere
better to get all these things out of our heads, and return to my
uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXV</small>
</h3>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the
corporal had marched down to the bottom of the avenue, they
recollected their business lay the other way; so they faced about
and marched up straight to Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s door.</p>

<p>I warrant your honour; said the corporal, touching his
<i>Montero</i>-cap with his hand, as he passed him in order to give a knock at the door——My uncle
<i>Toby</i>, contrary to his invariable way of treating his
faithful servant, said nothing good or bad: the truth was, he had
not altogether marshal’d his ideas; he wish’d for
another conference, and as the corporal was mounting up the three
steps before the door—he hem’d twice—a portion of
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s most modest spirits fled, at each
expulsion, towards the corporal; he stood with the rapper of the
door suspended for a full minute in his hand, he scarce knew why.
<i>Bridget</i> stood perdue within, with her finger and her thumb
upon the latch, benumb’d with expectation; and Mrs
<i>Wadman</i>, with an eye ready to be deflowered again, sat
breathless behind the window-curtain of her bed-chamber, watching
their approach.</p>

<p><i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——but as he
articulated the word, the minute expired, and <i>Trim</i> let fall
the rapper.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> perceiving that all hopes of a conference
were knock’d on the head by it——whistled
Lillabullero.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>’s finger
and thumb were upon the latch, the corporal did not knock as often
as perchance your honour’s taylor——I might have
taken my example something nearer home; for I owe mine, some five
and twenty pounds at least, and wonder at the man’s
patience——</p>

<p>——But this is nothing at all to the world: only
’tis a cursed thing to be in debt; and there seems to be a
fatality in the exchequers of some poor princes, particularly those
of our house, which no Economy can bind down in irons: for my own
part, I’m persuaded there is not any one prince, prelate,
pope, or potentate, great or small upon earth, more desirous in his
heart of keeping straight with the world than I am——or
who takes more likely means for it. I never give above half a
guinea——or walk with boots——or cheapen
tooth-picks——or lay out a shilling upon a band-box the year round; and for the six months I’m
in the country, I’m upon so small a scale, that with all the
good temper in the world, I outdo <i>Rousseau</i>, a bar
length——for I keep neither man or boy, or horse, or
cow, or dog, or cat, or any thing that can eat or drink, except a
thin poor piece of a Vestal (to keep my fire in), and who has
generally as bad an appetite as myself——but if you
think this makes a philosopher of me——I would not, my
good people! give a rush for your judgments.</p>

<p>True philosophy——but there is no treating the
subject whilst my uncle is whistling Lillabullero.</p>

<p>——You shall see the very place, Madam; said my uncle
<i>Toby.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> blush’d——look’d
towards the door——turn’d
pale——blush’d slightly
again——recover’d her natural
colour——blush’d worse than ever; which, for the
sake of the unlearned reader, I translate thus——</p>

<p>“<i>L—d! I cannot look at
it——</i></p>

<p>
<i>What would the world say if I look’d at it?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I should drop down, if I look’d at it—</i>
</p>

<p><i>I wish I could look at it—</i></p>

<p><i>There can be no sin in looking at it.</i></p>

<p><i>——I will look at it.</i>”</p>

<p>Whilst all this was running through Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s
imagination, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had risen from the sopha, and got
to the other side of the parlour door, to give <i>Trim</i> an order
about it in the passage——</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * *——I believe it is in the
garret, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——I saw it there,
an’ please your honour, this morning, answered
<i>Trim</i>——Then prithee, step directly for it,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and bring it into the
parlour.</p>

<p>The corporal did not approve of the orders, but most cheerfully
obeyed them. The first was not an act of his will—the second
was; so he put on his <i>Montero</i>-cap, and went as fast as his
lame knee would let him. My uncle <i>Toby</i> returned into the
parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sopha.</p>

<p>——You shall lay your finger upon the
place—said my uncle <i>Toby.</i>——I will not
touch it, however, quoth Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> to herself.</p>

<p>This requires a second translation:—it shews what little
knowledge is got by mere words—we must go up to the first
springs.</p>

<p>Now in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three
pages, I must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself.</p>

<p>Rub your hands thrice across your foreheads—blow your
noses—cleanse your emunctories—sneeze, my good
people!——God bless you——</p>

<p>Now give me all the help you can.</p>

<p>A<small>S</small> there are fifty different ends
(counting all ends in——as well civil as religious) for
which a woman takes a husband, the first sets about and carefully
weighs, then separates and distinguishes in her mind, which of all
that number of ends is hers; then by discourse, enquiry,
argumentation, and inference, she investigates and finds out
whether she has got hold of the right one——and if
she has——then, by pulling it gently this way and that
way, she further forms a judgment, whether it will not break in the
drawing.</p>

<p>The imagery under which <i>Slawkenbergius</i> impresses this
upon the reader’s fancy, in the beginning of his third Decad,
is so ludicrous, that the honour I bear the sex, will not suffer me
to quote it——otherwise it is not destitute of
humour.</p>

<p>“She first, saith <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, stops the
asse, and holding his halter in her left hand (lest he should get
away) she thrusts her right hand into the very bottom of his
pannier to search for it—For what?—you’ll not
know the sooner, quoth <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, for interrupting
me——</p>

<p>“I have nothing, good Lady, but empty
bottles;’ says the asse.</p>

<p>“I’m loaded with tripes;” says the
second.</p>

<p>——And thou art little better, quoth she to the
third; for nothing is there in thy panniers but trunk-hose and
pantofles—and so to the fourth and fifth, going on
one by one through the whole string, till coming to the asse which
carries it, she turns the pannier upside down, looks at
it—considers it—samples it—measures
it—stretches it—wets it—dries it—then takes
her teeth both to the warp and weft of it.</p>

<p>——Of what? for the love of Christ!</p>

<p>I am determined, answered <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, that all the
powers upon earth shall never wring that secret from my breast.</p>

<p>W<small>E</small> live in a world beset on all sides
with mysteries and riddles—and so ’tis no
matter——else it seems strange, that Nature, who makes
every thing so well to answer its destination, and seldom or never
errs, unless for pastime, in giving such forms and aptitudes to
whatever passes through her hands, that whether she designs for the
plough, the caravan, the cart—or whatever other creature she
models, be it but an asse’s foal, you are sure to have the thing you wanted; and
yet at the same time should so eternally bungle it as she does, in
making so simple a thing as a married man.</p>

<p>Whether it is in the choice of the clay——or that it
is frequently spoiled in the baking; by an excess of which a
husband may turn out too crusty (you know) on one
hand——or not enough so, through defect of heat, on the
other——or whether this great Artificer is not so
attentive to the little Platonic exigences <i>of that part</i> of
the species, for whose use she is fabricating
<i>this</i>——or that her Ladyship sometimes scarce
knows what sort of a husband will do——I know not: we
will discourse about it after supper.</p>

<p>It is enough, that neither the observation itself, or the
reasoning upon it, are at all to the purpose—but rather
against it; since with regard to my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
fitness for the marriage state, nothing was ever better: she had
formed him of the best and kindliest clay——had temper’d it with her own milk, and
breathed into it the sweetest spirit——she had made him
all gentle, generous, and humane——she had filled his
heart with trust and confidence, and disposed every passage which
led to it, for the communication of the tenderest
offices——she had moreover considered the other causes
for which matrimony was ordained——</p>

<p>And accordingly * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.</p>

<p>The <small>DONATION</small> was not defeated by my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s wound.</p>

<p>Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the Devil,
who is the great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised
scruples in Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>’s brain about it; and like a
true devil as he was, had done his own work at the same time, by
turning my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s Virtue thereupon into nothing
but <i>empty bottles, tripes, trunk-hose</i>, and
<i>pantofles.</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. <i>Bridget</i> had pawn’d
all the little stock of honour a poor chamber-maid was worth in the
world, that she would get to the bottom of the affair in ten days;
and it was built upon one of the most concessible <i>postulata</i>
in nature: namely, that whilst my uncle <i>Toby</i> was making love
to her mistress, the corporal could find nothing better to do, than
make love to her——“<i>And I’ll let him as
much as he will</i>, said <i>Bridget</i>, to get it out of
him.”</p>

<p>Friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one.
<i>Bridget</i> was serving her mistress’s interests in the
one—and doing the thing which most pleased herself in the
other: so had as many stakes depending upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s wound, as the Devil himself——Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> had but one—and as it possibly might be her
last (without discouraging Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, or discrediting her
talents) was determined to play her cards herself.</p>

<p>She wanted not encouragement: a child might have look’d
into his hand——there was such a plainness and
simplicity in his playing out what trumps he had——with
such an unmistrusting ignorance of the
<i>ten-ace</i>——and so naked and defenceless did he sit
upon the same sopha with widow <i>Wadman</i>, that a generous heart
would have wept to have won the game of him.</p>

<p>Let us drop the metaphor.</p>

<p>——A<small>ND</small> the story
too—if you please: for though I have all along been hastening
towards this part of it, with so much earnest desire, as well
knowing it to be the choicest morsel of what I had to offer to the
world, yet now that I am got to it, any one is welcome to take my
pen, and go on with the story for me that will—I see the
difficulties of the descriptions I’m going to
give—and feel my want of powers.</p>

<p>It is one comfort at least to me, that I lost some fourscore
ounces of blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked
me at the beginning of this chapter; so that I have still some
hopes remaining, it may be more in the serous or globular parts of
the blood, than in the subtile <i>aura</i> of the
brain——be it which it will—an Invocation can do
no hurt——and I leave the affair entirely to the
<i>invoked</i>, to inspire or to inject me according as he sees
good.</p>

<p>
G<small>ENTLE</small> Spirit of sweetest humour, who erst did sit upon the easy
pen of my beloved C<small>ERVANTES</small>; Thou who glidedst daily through his
lattice, and turned’st the twilight of his prison into noon-day
brightness by thy presence——tinged’st his little urn of water
with heaven-sent nectar, and all the time he wrote of <i>Sancho</i> and his
master, didst cast thy mystic mantle o’er his wither’d stump<a href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>, and wide extended it to all the evils
of his life——
</p>

<p>——Turn in hither, I beseech
thee!——behold these breeches!——they are all
I have in world——that piteous rent was given them at
<i>Lyons</i>——</p>

<p>My shirts! see what a deadly schism has happen’d amongst
’em—for the laps are in <i>Lombardy</i>, and the rest
of ’em here—I never had but six, and a cunning gypsey
of a laundress at <i>Milan</i> cut me off the <i>fore</i>-laps of
five—To do her justice, she did it with some
consideration—for I was returning out of <i>Italy.</i></p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, and a pistol tinder-box which
was moreover filch’d from me at <i>Sienna</i>, and twice that
I pay’d five Pauls for two hard eggs, once at
<i>Raddicoffini</i>, and a second time at <i>Capua</i>—I do
not think a journey through <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>,
provided a man keeps his temper all the way, so bad a thing as some
people would make you believe: there must be <i>ups</i> and
<i>downs</i>, or how the duce should we get into vallies where
Nature spreads so many tables of entertainment.—’Tis
nonsense to imagine they will lend you their voitures to be shaken
to pieces for nothing; and unless you pay twelve sous for greasing
your wheels, how should the poor peasant get butter to his
bread?—We really expect too much—and for the livre or
two above par for your suppers and bed—at the most they are
but one shilling and ninepence halfpenny——who would
embroil their philosophy for it? for heaven’s and for your
own sake, pay it——pay it with both hands open, rather
than leave <i>Disappointment</i> sitting drooping upon the eye of
your fair Hostess and her Damsels in the gate-way, at your
departure—and besides, my dear Sir, you get a sisterly kiss
of each of ’em worth a pound——at least I
did——</p>

<p>——For my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s amours running
all the way in my head, they had the same effect upon me as if they
had been my own——I was in the most perfect
state of bounty and good-will; and felt the kindliest harmony
vibrating within me, with every oscillation of the chaise alike; so
that whether the roads were rough or smooth, it made no difference;
every thing I saw or had to do with, touch’d upon some secret
spring either of sentiment or rapture.</p>

<p>——They were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I
instantly let down the fore-glass to hear them more
distinctly——’Tis <i>Maria;</i> said the
postillion, observing I was listening——Poor
<i>Maria</i>, continued he (leaning his body on one side to let me
see her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is sitting upon a bank
playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside
her.</p>

<p>The young fellow utter’d this with an accent and a look so
perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow,
I would give him a four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to
<i>Moulins</i>——</p>

<p>——And who is poor <i>Maria?</i> said I.</p>

<p>The love and piety of all the villages around us; said the
postillion——it is but three years ago, that the sun did
not shine upon so fair, so quick- witted and amiable a maid; and
better fate did <i>Maria</i> deserve, than to have her Banns
forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published
them——</p>

<p>He was going on, when <i>Maria</i>, who had made a short pause,
put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air
again——they were the same notes;——yet were
ten times sweeter: It is the evening service to the Virgin, said
the young man——but who has taught her to play
it—or how she came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that
heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she has been
unsettled in her mind, it seems her only
consolation——she has never once had the pipe out of her
hand, but plays that <i>service</i> upon it almost night and
day.</p>

<p>The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and
natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition, and should
have sifted out his history, had not poor <i>Maria</i> taken such
full possession of me.</p>

<p>We had got up by this time almost to the bank where <i>Maria</i>
was sitting: she was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but
two tresses, drawn up into a silk-net, with a few olive leaves
twisted a little fantastically on one side——she was
beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest
heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her——</p>

<p>——God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses,
said the postillion, have been said in the several parish churches
and convents around, for her,——but without effect; we
have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the
Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but her parents, who
know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses
are lost for ever.</p>

<p>As the postillion spoke this, M<small>ARIA</small> made a
cadence so melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out
of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt
her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>M<small>ARIA</small> look’d wistfully for some time at me,
and then at her goat——and then at me——and
then at her goat again, and so on, alternately——</p>

<p>——Well, <i>Maria</i>, said I
softly——What resemblance do you find?</p>

<p>I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from
the humblest conviction of what a <i>Beast</i> man
is,——that I asked the question; and that I would not
have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable
presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever
<i>Rabelais</i> scatter’d——and yet I own my heart
smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that I
swore I would set up for Wisdom, and utter grave sentences the rest
of my days——and never——never attempt again
to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to
live.</p>

<p>As for writing nonsense to them——I believe there was
a reserve—but that I leave to the world.</p>

<p>Adieu, <i>Maria!</i>—adieu, poor hapless
damsel!——some time, but not now, I may hear thy sorrows
from thy own lips——but I was deceived; for that moment
she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I
rose up, and with broken and irregular steps walk’d softly to
my chaise.</p>

<p>——What an excellent inn at <i>Moulins!</i></p>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> we have got to the end of this
chapter (but not before) we must all turn back to the two blank
chapters, on the account of which my honour has lain bleeding this
half hour——I stop it, by pulling off one of my yellow
slippers and throwing it with all my violence to the opposite side
of my room, with a declaration at the heel of it——</p>

<p>——That whatever resemblance it may bear to half the
chapters which are written in the world, or for aught I know may be
now writing in it—that it was as casual as the foam of <i>Zeuxis</i> his
horse; besides, I look upon a chapter which has <i>only nothing in
it</i>, with respect; and considering what worse things there are
in the world——That it is no way a proper subject for
satire——</p>

<p>——Why then was it left so? And here without staying
for my reply, shall I be called as many blockheads, numsculs,
doddypoles, dunderheads, ninny-hammers, goosecaps, joltheads,
nincompoops, and sh- -t-a-beds——and other unsavoury
appellations, as ever the cake-bakers of <i>Lernè</i> cast
in the teeth of King <i>Garangantan</i>’s
shepherds——And I’ll let them do it, as
<i>Bridget</i> said, as much as they please; for how was it
possible they should foresee the necessity I was under of writing
the 84th chapter of my book, before the 77th, &amp;c?</p>

<p>——So I don’t take it amiss——All I
wish is, that it may be a lesson to the world, “<i>to let
people tell their stories their own way.</i>”</p>

<h3>
The Seventy-seventh Chapter
</h3>

<p>A<small>S</small> Mrs. <i>Bridget</i> opened the
door before the corporal had well given the rap, the interval
betwixt that and my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s introduction into the
parlour, was so short, that Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had but just time to
get from behind the curtain——lay a Bible upon the
table, and advance a step or two towards the door to receive
him.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> saluted Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, after the
manner in which women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord
God one thousand seven hundred and thirteen——then
facing about, he march’d up abreast with her to the sopha,
and in three plain words——though not before he was sat
down——nor after he was sat down——but as he
was sitting down, told her, “<i>he was in
love</i>”——so that my uncle <i>Toby</i> strained
himself more in the declaration than he needed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> naturally looked down, upon a slit she had
been darning up in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my
uncle <i>Toby</i> would go on; but having no talents for
amplification, and Love moreover of all others being a subject of
which he was the least a master——When he had told Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the
matter to work after its own way.</p>

<p>My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s, as he falsely called it, and would often say,
that could his brother <i>Toby</i> to his processe have added but a
pipe of tobacco——he had wherewithal to have found his
way, if there was faith in a <i>Spanish</i> proverb, towards the
hearts of half the women upon the globe.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> never understood what my father meant; nor
will I presume to extract more from it, than a condemnation of an
error which the bulk of the world lie under——but the
<i>French</i>, every one of ’em to a man, who believe in it, almost as much as the <small>REAL
PRESENCE</small>, “<i>That talking of love, is making
it.</i>”</p>

<p>——I would as soon set about making a black-pudding
by the same receipt.</p>

<p>Let us go on: Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> sat in expectation my uncle
<i>Toby</i> would do so, to almost the first pulsation of that
minute, wherein silence on one side or the other, generally becomes
indecent: so edging herself a little more towards him, and raising
up her eyes, sub blushing, as she did it——she took up
the gauntlet——or the discourse (if you like it better)
and communed with my uncle <i>Toby</i>, thus:</p>

<p>The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>, are very great. I suppose so—said my uncle
<i>Toby:</i> and therefore when a person, continued Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>, is so much at his ease as you are—so happy,
captain <i>Shandy</i>, in yourself, your friends and your
amusements—I wonder, what reasons can incline you to the
state——</p>

<p>——They are written, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in
the Common-Prayer Book.</p>

<p>Thus far my uncle <i>Toby</i> went on warily, and kept within
his depth, leaving Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> to sail upon the gulph as she
pleased.</p>

<p>——As for children—said Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>—though a principal end perhaps of the
institution, and the natural wish, I suppose, of every
parent—yet do not we all find, they are certain sorrows, and
very uncertain comforts? and what is there, dear sir, to pay one
for the heart-achs—what compensation for the many tender and
disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who
brings them into life? I declare, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, smit
with pity, I know of none; unless it be the pleasure which it has
pleased God——</p>

<p>A fiddlestick! quoth she.</p>

<h3>
Chapter the Seventy-eighth
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> there are such an infinitude of
notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs, looks, and accents with which
the word <i>fiddlestick</i> may be pronounced in all
such causes as this, every one of ’em impressing a sense and
meaning as different from the other, as <i>dirt</i> from
<i>cleanliness</i>—That Casuists (for it is an affair of
conscience on that score) reckon up no less than fourteen thousand
in which you may do either right or wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> hit upon the <i>fiddlestick</i>, which
summoned up all my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s modest blood into his
cheeks—so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other
got beyond his depth, he stopt short; and without entering further
either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand
upon his heart, and made an offer to take them as they were, and
share them along with her.</p>

<p>When my uncle <i>Toby</i> had said this, he did not care to say
it again; so casting his eye upon the Bible which Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i> had laid upon the table, he took it up; and popping,
dear soul! upon a passage in it, of all others the most interesting
to him—which was the siege of <i>Jericho</i>—he set
himself to read it over—leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done his declaration of love, to work with
her after its own way. Now it wrought neither as an astringent or a
loosener; nor like opium, or bark, or mercury, or buckthorn, or any
one drug which nature had bestowed upon the world—in short,
it work’d not at all in her; and the cause of that was, that
there was something working there before——Babbler that
I am! I have anticipated what it was a dozen times; but there is
fire still in the subject——allons.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is natural for a perfect stranger
who is going from <i>London</i> to <i>Edinburgh</i>, to enquire
before he sets out, how many miles to <i>York;</i> which is about
the half way——nor does any body wonder, if he goes on
and asks about the corporation, &amp;c. - -</p>

<p>It was just as natural for Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, whose first
husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know
how far from the hip to the groin; and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in
her feelings, in the one case than in the other.</p>

<p>
She had accordingly read <i>Drake</i>’s anatomy from one end to the
other. She had peeped into <i>Wharton</i> upon the brain, and borrowed<a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> <i>Graaf</i> upon the bones and
muscles; but could make nothing of it.
</p>

<p>She had reason’d likewise from her own
powers——laid down theorems——drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.</p>

<p>To clear up all, she had twice asked Doctor <i>Slop</i>,
“if poor captain <i>Shandy</i> was ever likely to
recover of his wound——?”</p>

<p>——He is recovered, Doctor <i>Slop</i> would
say——</p>

<p>What! quite?</p>

<p>Quite: madam——</p>

<p>But what do you mean by a recovery? Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> would
say.</p>

<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i> was the worst man alive at definitions; and
so Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> could get no knowledge: in short, there was
no way to extract it, but from my uncle <i>Toby</i> himself.</p>

<p>There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which
lulls S<small>USPICION</small> to rest——and I am half
persuaded the serpent got pretty near it, in his discourse with
Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so
great, that she should have boldness to hold chat with the devil,
without it——But there is an accent of
humanity——how shall I describe it?—’tis an
accent which covers the part with a garment, and gives the enquirer
a right to be as particular with it, as your body-surgeon.</p>

<p>“——Was it without remission?—</p>

<p>“——Was it more tolerable in bed?</p>

<p>“——Could he lie on both sides alike with
it?</p>

<p>“——Was he able to mount a horse?</p>

<p>“——Was motion bad for it?’ <i>et
cætera</i>, were so tenderly spoke to, and so directed
towards my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s heart, that every item of them
sunk ten times deeper into it than the evils themselves——but
when Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> went round about by <i>Namur</i> to get at
my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s groin; and engaged him to attack the
point of the advanced counterscarp, and <i>péle mele</i>
with the <i>Dutch</i> to take the counterguard of St. <i>Roch</i>
sword in hand—and then with tender notes playing upon his
ear, led him all bleeding by the hand out of the trench, wiping her
eye, as he was carried to his tent——Heaven! Earth!
Sea!—all was lifted up—the springs of nature rose above
their levels—an angel of mercy sat besides him on the
sopha—his heart glow’d with fire—and had he been
worth a thousand, he had lost every heart of them to Mrs.
<i>Wadman.</i></p>

<p>—And whereabouts, dear sir, quoth Mrs. <i>Wadman</i>, a
little categorically, did you receive this sad
blow?——In asking this question, Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> gave
a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s red plush breeches, expecting naturally, as the
shortest reply to it, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> would lay his
fore-finger upon the place——It fell out
otherwise——for my uncle <i>Toby</i> having got his wound before the gate of St. <i>Nicolas</i>,
in one of the traverses of the trench opposite to the salient angle
of the demibastion of St. <i>Roch;</i> he could at any time stick a
pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when
the stone struck him: this struck instantly upon my uncle
<i>Toby</i>’s sensorium——and with it, struck his
large map of the town and citadel of <i>Namur</i> and its environs,
which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board, by the
corporal’s aid, during his long illness——it had
lain with other military lumber in the garret ever since, and
accordingly the corporal was detached to the garret to fetch
it.</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> measured off thirty toises, with Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s scissars, from the returning angle before the
gate of St. <i>Nicolas;</i> and with such a virgin modesty laid her
finger upon the place, that the goddess of Decency, if then in
being—if not, ’twas her shade—shook her head, and
with a finger wavering across her eyes—forbid her to explain
the mistake.</p>

<p>Unhappy Mrs. <i>Wadman!</i></p>

<p>——For nothing can make this chapter go off with
spirit but an apostrophe to thee——but my heart tells
me, that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an insult in
disguise, and ere I would offer one to a woman in
distress—let the chapter go to the devil; provided any
damn’d critic in <i>keeping</i> will be but at the trouble to
take it with him.</p>

This must be a mistake in Mr. <i>Shandy;</i> for <i>Graaf</i> wrote upon the
pancreatick juice, and the parts of generation.

<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXVI</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small>y uncle <i>Toby</i>’s Map is
carried down into the kitchen.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXVII</small>
</h3>

<p>——A<small>ND</small> here is the
<i>Maes</i>—and this is the <i>Sambre;</i> said the corporal,
pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map, and
his left upon Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>’s shoulder—but not
the shoulder next him—and this, said he, is the town of
<i>Namur</i>—and this the citadel—and there lay the
<i>French</i>—and here lay his honour and
myself——and in this cursed trench, Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>,
quoth the corporal, taking her by the hand, did he receive the wound which crush’d
him so miserably <i>here.</i>——In pronouncing which, he
slightly press’d the back of her hand towards the part he
felt for——and let it fall.</p>

<p>We thought, Mr. <i>Trim</i>, it had been more in the
middle,——said Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>——</p>

<p>That would have undone us for ever—said the corporal.</p>

<p>——And left my poor mistress undone too, said
<i>Bridget.</i></p>

<p>The corporal made no reply to the repartee, but by giving Mrs.
<i>Bridget</i> a kiss.</p>

<p>Come—come—said <i>Bridget</i>—holding the palm
of her left hand parallel to the plane of the horizon, and sliding
the fingers of the other over it, in a way which could not have
been done, had there been the least wart or
protruberance——’Tis every syllable of it false,
cried the corporal, before she had half finished the
sentence——</p>

<p>—I know it to be fact, said <i>Bridget</i>, from credible
witnesses.</p>

<p>——Upon my honour, said the corporal, laying his hand
upon his heart, and blushing, as he spoke, with honest
resentment—’tis a story, Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, as false
as hell——Not, said <i>Bridget</i>, interrupting him,
that either I or my mistress care a halfpenny about it, whether
’tis so or no——only that when one is married, one
would chuse to have such a thing by one at least——</p>

<p>It was somewhat unfortunate for Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, that she
had begun the attack with her manual exercise; for the corporal
instantly * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* *.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXVIII</small>
</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> was like the momentary contest in
the moist eye-lids of an <i>April</i> morning, “Whether
Bridget should laugh or cry.”</p>

<p>She snatch’d up a rolling-pin——’twas ten
to one, she had laugh’d——</p>

<p>She laid it down——she cried; and had one single tear
of ’em but tasted of bitterness, full sorrowful would the
corporal’s heart have been that he had used the
argument; but the corporal understood the sex, a <i>quart major to
a terce</i> at least, better than my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and
accordingly he assailed Mrs. <i>Bridget</i> after this manner.</p>

<p>I know, Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, said the corporal, giving her a
most respectful kiss, that thou art good and modest by nature, and
art withal so generous a girl in thyself, that, if I know thee
rightly, thou would’st not wound an insect, much less the
honour of so gallant and worthy a soul as my master, wast thou sure
to be made a countess of——but thou hast been set on,
and deluded, dear <i>Bridget</i>, as is often a woman’s case,
“to please others more than
themselves——”</p>

<p><i>Bridget</i>’s eyes poured down at the sensations the
corporal excited.</p>

<p>——Tell me——tell me, then, my dear
<i>Bridget</i>, continued the corporal, taking hold of her hand,
which hung down dead by her side,——and giving a second
kiss——whose suspicion has misled thee?</p>

<p><i>Bridget</i> sobb’d a sob or two——then
open’d her eyes——the corporal wiped ’em
with the bottom of her apron——she then open’d her
heart and told him all.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;LXXXIX</small>
</h3>

<p>M<small>Y</small> uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal
had gone on separately with their operations the greatest part of
the campaign, and as effectually cut off from all communication of
what either the one or the other had been doing, as if they had
been separated from each other by the <i>Maes</i> or the
<i>Sambre.</i></p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, on his side, had presented himself every
afternoon in his red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and
sustained an infinity of attacks in them, without knowing them to
be attacks—and so had nothing to
communicate——</p>

<p>The corporal, on his side, in taking <i>Bridget</i>, by it had
gain’d considerable advantages——and consequently
had much to communicate——but what were the
advantages——as well as what was the manner by which he
had seiz’d them, required so nice an historian, that the
corporal durst not venture upon it; and as sensible as he was of
glory, would rather have been contented to have gone bareheaded and
without laurels for ever, than torture his master’s modesty
for a single moment——</p>

<p>——Best of honest and gallant
servants!——But I have apostrophiz’d thee,
<i>Trim!</i> once before——and could I apotheosize thee
also (that is to say) with good company——I would do it
<i>without ceremony</i> in the very next page.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XC</small>
</h3>

<p>N<small>OW</small> my uncle <i>Toby</i> had one
evening laid down his pipe upon the table, and was counting over to
himself upon his finger ends (beginning at his thumb) all Mrs.
<i>Wadman</i>’s perfections one by one; and happening two or
three times together, either by omitting some, or counting
others twice over, to puzzle himself sadly before he could get
beyond his middle finger——Prithee, <i>Trim!</i> said
he, taking up his pipe again,——bring me a pen and ink:
<i>Trim</i> brought paper also.</p>

<p>Take a full sheet——<i>Trim!</i> said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, making a sign with his pipe at the same time to take a
chair and sit down close by him at the table. The corporal
obeyed——placed the paper directly before
him——took a pen, and dipp’d it in the ink.</p>

<p>—She has a thousand virtues, <i>Trim!</i> said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>——</p>

<p>Am I to set them down, an’ please your honour? quoth the
corporal.</p>

<p>——But they must be taken in their ranks, replied my
uncle <i>Toby;</i> for of them all, <i>Trim</i>, that which wins me
most, and which is a security for all the rest, is the
compassionate turn and singular humanity of her character—I
protest, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking up, as he protested
it, towards the top of the ceiling—That was I her brother, <i>Trim</i>, a
thousand fold, she could not make more constant or more tender
enquiries after my sufferings——though now no more.</p>

<p>The corporal made no reply to my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
protestation, but by a short cough—he dipp’d the pen a
second time into the inkhorn; and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, pointing
with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the
left hand corner of it, as he could get it——the
corporal wrote down the word<br>
H&nbsp;U&nbsp;M&nbsp;A&nbsp;N&nbsp;I&nbsp;T&nbsp;Y - - - -
thus.</p>

<p>Prithee, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as soon as
<i>Trim</i> had done it——how often does Mrs.
<i>Bridget</i> enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee,
which thou received’st at the battle of <i>Landen?</i></p>

<p>She never, an’ please your honour, enquires after it at
all.</p>

<p>That, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with all the triumph
the goodness of his nature would permit——That shews the
difference in the character of the mistress and maid——had the fortune of war
allotted the same mischance to me, Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> would have
enquired into every circumstance relating to it a hundred
times——She would have enquired, an’ please your
honour, ten times as often about your honour’s
groin——The pain, <i>Trim</i>, is equally
excruciating,——and Compassion has as much to do with
the one as the other——</p>

<p>——God bless your honour! cried the
corporal——what has a woman’s compassion to do
with a wound upon the cap of a man’s knee? had your
honour’s been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair
of <i>Landen</i>, Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> would have troubled her head
as little about it as <i>Bridget;</i> because, added the corporal,
lowering his voice, and speaking very distinctly, as he assigned
his reason——</p>

<p>“The knee is such a distance from the main
body——whereas the groin, your honour knows, is upon the
very <i>curtain</i> of the <i>place.</i>”</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> gave a long whistle——but in a
note which could scarce be heard across the table.</p>

<p>The corporal had advanced too far to retire——in
three words he told the rest——</p>

<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> laid down his pipe as gently upon the
fender, as if it had been spun from the unravellings of a
spider’s web——</p>

<p>——Let us go to my brother <i>Shandy</i>’s,
said he.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCI</small>
</h3>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> will be just time, whilst my
uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> are walking to my father’s,
to inform you that Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had, some moons before this,
made a confident of my mother; and that Mrs. <i>Bridget</i>, who
had the burden of her own, as well as her mistress’s secret
to carry, had got happily delivered of both to <i>Susannah</i>
behind the garden-wall.</p>

<p>As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the
least bustle about——but <i>Susannah</i> was sufficient
by herself for all the ends and purposes you could possibly have,
in exporting a family secret; for she instantly imparted it by
signs to <i>Jonathan</i>——and <i>Jonathan</i> by tokens
to the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it
with some kitchen-fat to the postillion for a groat, who
truck’d it with the dairy maid for something of about the
same value——and though whisper’d in the hay-loft,
F<small>AME</small> caught the notes with her brazen trumpet, and
sounded them upon the house-top—In a word, not an old woman
in the village or five miles round, who did not understand the
difficulties of my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s siege, and what were
the secret articles which had delayed the
surrender.——</p>

<p>My father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an
hypothesis, by which means never man crucified T<small>RUTH</small>
at the rate he did——had but just heard of the report as
my uncle <i>Toby</i> set out; and catching fire suddenly at
the trespass done his brother by it, was demonstrating to
<i>Yorick</i>, notwithstanding my mother was sitting
by——not only, “That the devil was in women,
and that the whole of the affair was lust;” but that every
evil and disorder in the world, of what kind or nature soever, from
the first fall of <i>Adam</i>, down to my uncle <i>Toby</i>’s
(inclusive), was owing one way or other to the same unruly
appetite.</p>

<p><i>Yorick</i> was just bringing my father’s hypothesis to
some temper, when my uncle <i>Toby</i> entering the room with marks
of infinite benevolence and forgiveness in his looks, my
father’s eloquence re-kindled against the
passion——and as he was not very nice in the choice of
his words when he was wroth——as soon as my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was seated by the fire, and had filled his pipe, my
father broke out in this manner.</p>

<h3>
<small>C&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;P.&nbsp;
&nbsp;XCII</small>
</h3>

<p>——T<small>HAT</small> provision should
be made for continuing the race of so great, so exalted and godlike
a Being as man—I am far from denying—but philosophy
speaks freely of every thing; and therefore I still think and do
maintain it to be a pity, that it should be done by means of a
passion which bends down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom,
contemplations, and operations of the soul backwards——a
passion, my dear, continued my father, addressing himself to my
mother, which couples and equals wise men with fools, and makes us
come out of our caverns and hiding-places more like satyrs and
four-footed beasts than men.</p>

<p>I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of
the <i>Prolepsis</i>), that in itself, and simply
taken——like hunger, or thirst, or
sleep——’tis an affair neither good or
bad—or shameful or otherwise.——Why then did the
delicacy of <i>Diogenes</i> and <i>Plato</i> so recalcitrate
against it? and wherefore, when we go about to make and plant a
man, do we put out the candle? and for what reason is it, that all
the parts thereof—the congredients—the
preparations—the instruments, and whatever serves thereto,
are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language,
translation, or periphrasis whatever?</p>

<p>——The act of killing and destroying a man, continued
my father, raising his voice—and turning to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—you see, is glorious—and the weapons by
which we do it are honourable——We march with them upon
our shoulders——We strut with them by our
sides——We gild them——We carve
them——We in-lay them——We enrich
them——Nay, if it be but a <i>scoundrel</i> cannon, we
cast an ornament upon the breach of it.—</p>

<p>——My uncle <i>Toby</i> laid down his pipe to
intercede for a better epithet——and <i>Yorick</i> was
rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to
pieces——</p>

<p>——When <i>Obadiah</i> broke into the middle of the
room with a complaint, which cried out for an immediate
hearing.</p>

<p>The case was this:</p>

<p>My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as
impropriator of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a Bull for
the service of the Parish, and <i>Obadiah</i> had led his cow upon
a <i>pop-visit</i> to him one day or other the preceding
summer——I say, one day or other—because as chance
would have it, it was the day on which he was married to my
father’s house-maid——so one was a reckoning to
the other. Therefore when <i>Obadiah</i>’s wife was brought
to bed—<i>Obadiah</i> thanked God——</p>

<p>——Now, said <i>Obadiah</i>, I shall have a calf: so
<i>Obadiah</i> went daily to visit his cow.</p>

<p>She’ll calve on <i>Monday</i>—on
<i>Tuesday</i>—on <i>Wednesday</i> at the
farthest——</p>

<p>The cow did not calve——no—she’ll not
calve till next week——the cow put it off
terribly——till at the end of the sixth week <i>Obadiah</i>’s suspicions (like a
good man’s) fell upon the Bull.</p>

<p>Now the parish being very large, my father’s Bull, to
speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had,
however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into
employment—and as he went through the business with a grave
face, my father had a high opinion of him.</p>

<p>——Most of the townsmen, an’ please your
worship, quoth <i>Obadiah</i>, believe that ’tis all the
Bull’s fault——</p>

<p>——But may not a cow be barren? replied my father,
turning to Doctor <i>Slop.</i></p>

<p>It never happens: said Dr. <i>Slop</i>, but the man’s wife
may have come before her time naturally enough——Prithee
has the child hair upon his head?—added Dr.
<i>Slop</i>——</p>

<p>——It is as hairy as I am; said
<i>Obadiah.——Obadiah</i> had not been shaved for three
weeks——Wheu - - u - - - - u - - - - - - - - cried my
father; beginning the sentence with an exclamatory whistle——and so, brother <i>Toby</i>,
this poor Bull of mine, who is as good a Bull as ever
p—ss’d, and might have done for <i>Europa</i> herself
in purer times——had he but two legs less, might have
been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his
character——which to a Town Bull, brother <i>Toby</i>,
is the very same thing as his life——</p>

<p>L—d! said my mother, what is all this story
about?——</p>

<p>A C<small>OCK</small> and a B<small>ULL</small>, said
<i>Yorick</i>——And one of the best of its kind, I ever
heard.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
